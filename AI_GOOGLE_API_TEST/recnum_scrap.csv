Bourbon Brined Fried Chicken Recipe | Damaris Phillips | Food Network, 2/3 cup bourbon 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 2 dried bay leaves 8 black peppercorns Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Eight 10- to 12-ounce skin-on bone-in chicken breasts 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder 1 cup buttermilk 1 large egg 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 3/4 cup finely ground cornmeal 1 tablespoon garlic powder 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup canola oil 1 cup unrefined coconut oil , Watch how to make this recipe.

Special equipment: a 1-gallon resealable freezer bag 14-inch cast-iron skillet and deep-fry thermometer

              For the brine: In a large bowl combine the bourbon brown sugar bay leaves peppercorns and 1/4 cup salt. Stir to combine. Pour in 4 cups warm water from the tap and stir until the brown sugar dissolves.
            

              Put chicken in a 1-gallon resealable freezer bag and pour in the brine. The chicken should be completely submerged. Seal the bag and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.
            

              Pour off the brine and place the chicken on a cooling rack. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper before dredging.
            

              Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
            

              For the breading: You will need three medium bowls for the breading. In one bowl combine 1 cup of the flour with 1/2 teaspoon baking powder. In a second bowl whisk together the buttermilk egg and mustard. In a third bowl combine the remaining 1 1/2 cups flour and 3/4 teaspoon baking powder along with the cornmeal garlic powder cayenne 1 tablespoon salt and 1 tablespoon pepper.
            

              Follow a basic three step breading process: Dip each chicken breast in the flour (dusting off any excess) then in the buttermilk mixture and finally in the cornmeal mixture. Dust off any excess before laying each chicken breast on a cooling rack. Allow the chicken to sit out uncovered for 30 minutes. This will make for a crunchier crust.
            

              Set a cooling rack in a rimmed baking sheet. In a 14-inch cast-iron skillet combine the canola and coconut oils and heat over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 345 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches place the chicken in the skillet bone-side up. The oil should only come halfway up the side of the chicken. Cook until golden brown about 5 minutes. Carefully flip and cook until golden brown on the other side 5 to 7 minutes more. If needed cook on the thicker side of the chicken breast for another minute to crisp the crust. Transfer to the rack as done.
            

              Wipe up any oil drips from the baking sheet so they don't smoke up your kitchen. Transfer the chicken on the rack and baking sheet to the oven and bake until cooked through and the center registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer 10 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to rest and carry over cooking another 5 degrees F before serving about 5 minutes.

Carefully flip and cook until golden brown on the other side 5 to 7 minutes more. If needed cook on the thicker side of the chicken breast for another minute to crisp the crust. Transfer to the rack as done.
            

              Wipe up any oil drips from the baking sheet so they don't smoke up your kitchen. Transfer the chicken on the rack and baking sheet to the oven and bake until cooked through and the center registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer 10 to 20 minutes.

Bourbon Brined Fried Chicken Recipe | Damaris Phillips | Food Network, 2/3 cup bourbon 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 2 dried bay leaves 8 black peppercorns Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Eight 10- to 12-ounce skin-on bone-in chicken breasts 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder 1 cup buttermilk 1 large egg 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 3/4 cup finely ground cornmeal 1 tablespoon garlic powder 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup canola oil 1 cup unrefined coconut oil , Watch how to make this recipe.

Special equipment: a 1-gallon resealable freezer bag 14-inch cast-iron skillet and deep-fry thermometer

              For the brine: In a large bowl combine the bourbon brown sugar bay leaves peppercorns and 1/4 cup salt. Stir to combine. Pour in 4 cups warm water from the tap and stir until the brown sugar dissolves.
            

              Put chicken in a 1-gallon resealable freezer bag and pour in the brine. The chicken should be completely submerged. Seal the bag and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.
            

              Pour off the brine and place the chicken on a cooling rack. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper before dredging.
            

              Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
            

              For the breading: You will need three medium bowls for the breading. In one bowl combine 1 cup of the flour with 1/2 teaspoon baking powder. In a second bowl whisk together the buttermilk egg and mustard. In a third bowl combine the remaining 1 1/2 cups flour and 3/4 teaspoon baking powder along with the cornmeal garlic powder cayenne 1 tablespoon salt and 1 tablespoon pepper.
            

              Follow a basic three step breading process: Dip each chicken breast in the flour (dusting off any excess) then in the buttermilk mixture and finally in the cornmeal mixture. Dust off any excess before laying each chicken breast on a cooling rack. Allow the chicken to sit out uncovered for 30 minutes. This will make for a crunchier crust.
            

              Set a cooling rack in a rimmed baking sheet. In a 14-inch cast-iron skillet combine the canola and coconut oils and heat over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 345 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches place the chicken in the skillet bone-side up. The oil should only come halfway up the side of the chicken. Cook until golden brown about 5 minutes. Carefully flip and cook until golden brown on the other side 5 to 7 minutes more. If needed cook on the thicker side of the chicken breast for another minute to crisp the crust. Transfer to the rack as done.
            

              Wipe up any oil drips from the baking sheet so they don't smoke up your kitchen. Transfer the chicken on the rack and baking sheet to the oven and bake until cooked through and the center registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer 10 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to rest and carry over cooking another 5 degrees F before serving about 5 minutes.

Breakfast Macaroni and Cheese with Sausage and Hash Browns Recipe | Food Network Kitchen | Food Network, Kosher salt 1 pound elbow macaroni 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 pound breakfast sausage casings removed 1 large yellow onion chopped 2 small green bell peppers chopped 2 1/2 cups half-and-half 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 pound cream cheese room temperature 8 ounces sharp Cheddar shredded (about 3 cups) 3 ounces Gruyere shredded (about 1 cup) 1 1/2 cups frozen shredded hash browns thawed 4 tablespoons unsalted butter melted , Watch how to make this recipe.


              Set an oven rack 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
            

              Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook until it is al dente about 6 minutes. Strain reserving 1 3/4 cups of the pasta water. Set aside.
            

              Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until lightly browned breaking up the meat with the back of a wooden spoon about 5 minutes. Transfer the browned meat to a plate with a slotted spoon. Add the onions 1 tablespoon water and a pinch of salt to the saucepan and cook until just starting to soften 3 to 4 minutes scraping up any browned bits with the wooden spoon. Add the bell peppers and cook until lightly browned and softened 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the onion and green bell pepper to the plate with the browned sausage.
            

              Carefully wipe out the saucepan (or give it a quick rinse if it is really dirty). Add the half-and-half and cayenne and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook until reduced to 1 1/2 cups about 15 minutes. Add the cream cheese and stir until melted. Whisk in the Cheddar and Gruyere until all the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth.
            

              Add the macaroni and reserved pasta water to the saucepan and stir to combine. (The mixture will look very loose but the pasta will suck up a lot of the sauce as it bakes.) Gently fold in the browned meat and vegetables and season with more salt if needed. Pour into a 13-by-9-inch baking dish. Toss the hash browns with the melted butter and a pinch of salt and scatter over the macaroni and cheese. Bake until the cheese is bubbly and the hash browns are just starting to brown about 10 minutes. Broil until the hash browns are golden brown and crispy about 3 minutes.

Mint Pesto Pasta Recipe | Food Network, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound bowtie pasta (farfalle) 4 cups packed fresh mint leaves (about 4 1/2 ounces) plus several whole leaves for garnish 3 tablespoons (about 1 1/2 ounces)unsalted toasted pistachios 1 clove garlic lightly crushed 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil One 2 1/2-ounce wedge pecorino plus 1 handful grated for garnish Juice of 1/2 a large lemon A dollop of unsalted butter optional Fresh mint leaves for garnish ,               Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the manufacturer's instructions for al dente pasta.
            

              Meanwhile put the mint leaves pistachios and garlic in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. While still pulsing slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Remove the lid and use your hands to break up the wedge of pecorino into small chunks and add them to the food processor along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Pulse until well combined but there are still small pieces of pecorino throughout the mixture. (You do not want to blend too much because it will cause the mint to brown.) Season with additional salt and pepper if needed.
            

              Transfer the pesto to a large high-sided skillet. When the pasta is cooked to al dente use a large slotted spoon to lift the pasta out of the pot and directly into the skillet. Stir to combine. Turn the heat to medium-high and cook stirring occasionally until the excess water from the pasta has evaporated and some of the pecorino has started to melt 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and butter if using. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed.
            

              Transfer to a large platter and garnish with the grated pecorino and whole mint leaves. Serve warm or at room temperature.

              Stir the light brown and granulated sugars and vanilla into the chocolate mixture with a wooden spoon. Add the eggs and buttermilk and beat vigorously until thick and glossy.

Lemonade with Lemonade Ice Cubes Recipe | Food Network, 2 cups fresh squeezed lemon juice 1 cup sugar 1 gallon cold water or to taste Fresh mint leaves 1 orange segmented ,               In a large pitcher whisk the lemon juice and sugar until sugar is dissolved. Add the water to taste. Fill 2 ice-cube trays with the lemonade and place a mint leaf and a piece of cut up orange segment in each compartment. Reserve the rest in the refrigerator. When frozen turn them into a frozen bowl or an ice sculpture and place on a buffet with the pitcher of lemonade beside them to serve over the ice cubes.
            

              Notes about the recipe: I love making ice cubes with surprises inside that add more flavor to a drink once they melt. And why have a melting ice cubes dilute a drink? Make it from something flavorful and it will add rather than take away from the taste. At Tru I make pineapple water ice cubes with candied lemon rind imbedded and serve them with plum or rhubarb lemonade.

Slow Roasted Duck Recipe | Jamie Oliver | Food Network, 2 (3 1/2 pound) Aylesbury ducks (1.5 kilograms) (can substitute Pekin ducks) Salt and freshly ground black pepper 9 ounces (255 grams) fresh ginger 2 long stalks baby rhubarb 2 handfuls fresh sage 1 bulb garlic cloves removed and chopped in half 2 red onions roughly sliced 2 wineglasses Marsala or Vin Santo 1 cup (285 milliliters) vegetable chicken or duck stock ,               Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
            

              Season the ducks generously putting some salt in the cavity as well. Make sure you save the fat and the giblets for the gravy.
            

              Coarsely grate half the ginger and rhubarb. Mix this in a bowl with half the sage and all the garlic and onion and stuff the mixture inside the cavity of the ducks ensuring there is an air cavity.
            

              Place the ducks on a tray on top of the chopped up giblets and roast in the oven for one hour. Turn the temperature down to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and cook for another 1 1/2 hours until crisp and tender. The ducks are ready when the skin is crisp and the leg bones can be easily removed.
            

              During this time you will need to drain the fat maybe 3 times into a bowl this will separate into a clear fat which you can keep for roasting.
            

              Once cooked allow the ducks to rest on a warmed plate while you make the sauce. Drain off any remaining fat from the roasting tray.
            

              Pull out all the stuffing and any juices from the inside of the duck and put in the roasting tray and warm this on a low heat.
            

              Add the Marsala and loosen all the sticky goodness from the bottom of the tray and reduce. Add the stock and reduce to a good taste and consistency.
            

              Pass the sauce trough a coarse sieve.
            

              Remove the breasts from the ducks with a knife and using your hands remove the thighs. Arrange the breasts and thighs on a large serving plate.
            

              Finely slice the remaining ginger and fry off in a little hot oil (or you can use the duck fat) in a non-stick pan. As the ginger begins to color add the rest of the rhubarb finely sliced and the rest of the sage. Fry until crisp. Sprinkle this over the duck and drizzle with the sauce.

Sheep's Milk Ricotta and Taleggio Ravioli with Wild Mushroom and Pancetta Sauce Recipe | Anne Burrell | Food Network, 1 pound all-purpose flour plus extra for rolling 5 large eggs 3 to 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt Semolina flour or polenta for dusting 2 cups sheep's milk ricotta 1 cup small dice or grated Taleggio 3 large eggs 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1/4 cup freshly chopped Italian parsley leaves Pimch kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup diced pancetta 3 garlic cloves smashed 1 cup each sliced shiitake oyster and cremini mushrooms Kosher salt 1 1/2 cups chicken stock 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan plus more for serving 1/4 cup freshly chopped chives ,               For the pasta dough: Put the flour in a pile on a clean dry work surface. Make a well about 8-inches wide in the center of the flour pile. Crack all the eggs into the hole add the olive oil and salt and beat the eggs with a fork. Using the fork slowly begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture. Do not worry about the lumps.
            

              When most of the flour is incorporated begin kneading the dough with your hands. Knead until it is smooth and supple about 10 to15 minutes. It is really important to put your whole body into kneading otherwise the pasta will not develop the proper consistency. You need to knead! Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it relax for at least 1 hour. If using immediately do not refrigerate.
            

              While the dough is resting make the filling: Combine all of the filling ingredients in a large bowl. Taste to make sure it is delicious. Put it in a pastry bag and refrigerate until ready to use.
            

              Roll the pasta: Set the pasta roller on the widest setting. Start with half the pasta dough. Using your hands flatten the dough as much as you can to facilitate it going through the pasta roller. Run the dough through the roller twice dusting it with flour in between rolls if it feels sticky. Fold it into thirds turn it 90 degrees and run it through the pasta machine 2 to 3 times. Continue to run the pasta through the machine reducing the setting between each run. Stop when you get to the second to last setting. Always hold the pasta on the tops of your hands palms down! If you hold it with your fingers up you will create stretch marks and those are never good.
            

              To assemble the ravioli: Lay the pasta sheet on a floured work surface. Brush the lower half of the pasta (the part that is closest to you) lightly with water. This is the "glue" that will hold the ravioli together. Use the glue sparingly if you use too much it will slide and not stick. Pipe 1-inch balls of filling onto the pasta that has been brushed with water leave about 2-inches between each ball. Fold the top half of the pasta over the pasta balls to meet the bottom edge. Using your 2 index fingers poke around each filling ball to seal the ravioli shut and make sure there are no air bubbles. Cut out each ravioli using a fluted round cutter. Transfer to a sheet tray coated with semolina. Cover and set aside until ready to use.
            

              To make the sauce: Coat a large saute pan with extra-virgin olive oil. Add the pancetta and garlic and saute over medium-high heat. When the garlic is light brown and aromatic remove it from the pan and discard it. When the pancetta is crispy add the mushrooms season with salt to taste and cook until they are soft and wilted. Add the chicken stock and cook until it has reduced by half. Stir in the butter shaking the pan frequently and cook until the sauce thickens and looks velvety. Taste for seasoning and add salt if needed.
            

              Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the ravioli and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully remove the ravioli from the water and immediately put it in the pan with the sauce. Bring to a boil shaking the pan frequently. Remove from the heat sprinkle in the Parmesan and swirl until it has combined with the sauce. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately sprinkled with a little more grated Parmesan and chopped chives. Mangia bene!!

              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              Heat the olive oil in a large (12-inch) saute pan over medium heat. Add the onion and celery and cook for 5 to 7 minutes stirring occasionally until the onion is translucent but not browned. Set aside to cool slightly.
            

              Place the beef veal pork parsley thyme chives eggs milk salt and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Put the panko in a food processor fitted with the steel blade and process until the panko is finely ground.

Pickle-Brined Pork Chops with Mushroom Escabeche and Smashed Potatoes Recipe | Kelsey Nixon | Food Network, 3/4 cup kosher salt 3/4 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons peppercorns 2 dried bay leaves 6 cloves garlic smashed Lemon peels from 1 lemon peeled with vegetable peeler 1 bunch fresh parsley stems 4 bone-in 2-inch-thick double pork chops 1 1/2 pounds small Yukon gold potatoes Kosher salt 3 tablespoons unsalted butter melted 1/2 cup half-and-half 1/2 cup cream cheese softened Freshly cracked black pepper 2 tablespoons canola oil 3/4 pound hon shimeji mushrooms cleaned and cut away from the root Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 cloves garlic minced 1 large shallot minced 1/2 cup sherry vinegar 2 teaspoons granulated sugar 1 teaspoon red chili flakes 2 lemons zested and juiced 1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Canola oil Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper ,               For brining the pork chops: Combine the salt sugar peppercorns bay leaves garlic lemon peels and parsley with 3 quarts water in a large pot or bowl and whisk together. Add the pork chops cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours turning once halfway through. This may seem like a long time but these are seriously big pork chops. Brining will make your pork so tender and flavor it throughout.
            

              For the smashed potatoes: Place the potatoes in large pot and cover with salted cold water. The potatoes will soak up that salt like pasta and it will make a big difference in flavor. Cover and bring to a boil and cook until fork-tender 20 to 30 minutes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the same pot allowing them to dry. Melt the butter with the half-and-half in a small saucepot over low heat. Add to the potatoes along with the cream cheese and season with salt and pepper. Smash with a potato masher and set aside keeping warm until ready to serve.
            

              For the mushroom escabeche: Heat the canola oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the mushrooms and saute until lightly browned in spots 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper remove from the heat and reserve. Heat the olive oil in a small saucepot over medium heat and saute the garlic and shallots until softened 2 to 3 minutes. Add the vinegar sugar chili flakes and lemon zest and juice. Bring to a simmer and then turn off the heat. Return the reserved mushrooms to the pot toss to combine and absorb all of that flavor. Garnish with parsley.
            

              For preparing the pork chops: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat a grill pan over high heat. Remove the chops from the brine and dry completely with paper towels. Drizzle with canola oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Place the chops on the grill and sear until browned 5 to 6 minutes on each side. Transfer to a sheet tray and finish cooking in the oven until an internal temperature reaches 135 to 140 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil. Let rest 5 to 10 minutes.
            

              Serve the pork chops over the smashed potatoes and top with the mushrooms.

Chef Anne's Pappardelle Recipe | Anne Burrell | Food Network, 1 pound all-purpose flour 4 whole eggs plus 1 yolk 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt ,               Place the flour on a clean dry work surface. Make a hole (this is also called a well) in the center of the flour pile that is about 8 inches wide (bigger is definitely better here). Crack all of the eggs and the yolk into the hole and add the olive oil salt and 1 to 2 tablespoons water.
            

              Using a fork beat the eggs together with the olive oil water (or more if needed) and salt. Using the fork begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture be careful not to break the sides of the well or the egg mixture will run all over your board and you will have a big mess! Also don't worry about the lumps. When enough flour has incorporated into the egg mixture that it will not run all over the place when the sides of the well are broken begin to use your hands to really get everything well combined. If the mixture is tight and dry wet your hands and begin kneading with wet hands. When the mixture has really come together to a homogeneous mixture THEN you can start kneading.
            

              When kneading it is VERY important to put your body weight into it get on top of the dough to really stretch it and not to tear the dough. Using the heels of your palms roll the dough to create a very smooooooth supple dough. When done the dough should look VERY smooth and feel almost velvety. Kneading will usually take from 8 to 10 minutes for an experienced kneader and 10 to 15 for an inexperienced kneader. Put your body weight into it you need to knead! This is where the perfect toothsome texture of your pasta is formed. Get in there and have fun!
            

              When the pasta has been kneaded to the perfect consistency wrap it in plastic and let rest for at least 1 hour. If using immediately do not refrigerate.
            

              To roll the pasta: Cut off 1/3 of the pasta dough reserve the rest and keep it covered.
            

              Squash the pasta with the heels of your hands to facilitate it going through the pasta roller. Dust with flour. Put the pasta through the roller set on number one. Roll the dough through 2 times dusting it with flour if it feels sticky or tacky.
            

              Fold the pasta into thirds and put it through the machine on number one again.
            

              Change the setting on the pasta roller to number two and run the pasta through. Continue to roll the pasta through the machine changing the setting each time to a larger number (this will make the opening on the pasta machine smaller). When you get to the desired thin-ness (I recommend number six) cut the pasta into 10-inch lengths. Flour the dough generously and stack them in a pile. Cover the stack with plastic or a clean tea towel and proceed rolling the rest of the pasta.
            

              When the pasta is all rolled take 3 sheets of pasta and fold both ends of the pasta over each other until they meet in the middle.
            

              Using a sharp knife cut the pasta rolls into 1-inch widths. Unroll the pasta "ribbons" and dust with semolina and reserve on sheet trays.
            

              When ready to use bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente 2 to 3 minutes. Drain.

Fresh Egg Pasta for Tajarin:


              Sift together and then mound 2 1/4 cups of the flour and a pinch of salt in the center of a large wooden cutting board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg yolks. Using a fork beat together the egg yolks and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.
            

              As you expand the well keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape. The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.
            

              Start kneading the dough with both hands using the palms of your hands. Knead for about 5 to 6 minutes adding any of the remaining flour if necessary to create a cohesive mass. Once you have a cohesive mass remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits. Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for six more minutes. The dough should be elastic and a little sticky. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Roll or shape as desired.

A Birthday Cake Recipe | Food Network Kitchen | Food Network, 1 1/2 cups unsalted butter (3 sticks) at room temperature plus more for preparing the pan 2 1/4 cups sugar 3 cups cake flour sifted plus more for preparing the pans 1 tablespoon baking powder 3/4 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup whole milk at room temperature 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract at room temperature 6 large egg whites room temperature About 4 to 6 cups VANILLA FROSTING or CHOCOLATE FROSTING recipes follow Food coloring (optional) Enough candles to equal the age of the birthday celebrant 1 1/2 pounds unsalted butter at room temperature 4 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon whole milk at room temperature 1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract at room temperature 1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1 pound semi-sweet chocolate roughly chopped 1 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/3 cup dark corn syrup plus more to taste ,               Lightly butter and flour two 9 x 1 1/2-inch round cake pans. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.
            

              In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment cream the butter at low speed until smooth about 1 minute. Slowly add the sugar and mix until just incorporated. Raise the speed to high and mix until light and fluffy about 10 minutes. (Occasionally turn the mixer off and scrape the sides of the bowl down with a rubber spatula.)
            

              Meanwhile sift the flour baking powder and salt together into a large bowl. In a small bowl whisk together the milk and vanilla.
            

              Reduce the mixer's speed to low. Alternately add the flour mixture and milk mixture waiting for each to be fully incorporated before adding the next (scrape the bowl down occasionally). Raise the speed to medium and mix briefly until a smooth batter is formed. Transfer the batter to a large bowl.
            

              Thoroughly clean the bowl of the mixer and place the egg whites inside. Using the whisk attachment whip the egg whites on high speed until stiff peaks are formed.
            

              Working in 3 batches using a rubber spatula fold the egg whites into the batter until just incorporated.
            

              Divide the cake batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Place the pans on the middle oven rack evenly spaced apart. Bake rotating the pans halfway through the cooking until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean about 30 minutes.
            

              Remove the cakes from the oven and run a knife around the edges to loosen them from the sides of the pans. One at a time invert the cakes onto a plate and then re-invert them onto a cooling rack rounded-sides up. Let cool completely.
            

              Frost the cake. Place one layer rounded-side down in the middle of a rotating cake stand. (If using the vanilla frosting reserve about 1 to 2 cups for coloring and decorating.) Using a palette knife or offset spatula spread about half of the frosting all over the cake. (Spread enough frosting over the top to make a 1/4-to-1/2-inch layer.) Carefully set the other layer on top rounded-side up and spread all over with the remaining frosting.
            

              If coloring the vanilla frosting place the reserved frosting in a medium bowl and stir in the food coloring little by little until the desired color is reached. Transfer the colored frosting to a pastry bag with small round or fluted tip or a plastic baggie with a small portion of a corner cut off.
            

              Using the colored frosting creatively write "Happy Birthday" to whomever and decorate the edges in fringes and whirls if desired. Serve immediately with lit candles or store at room temperature or in the refrigerator covered with a cake or pie lid. (If storing the cake in the refrigerator remember to remove it several hours before serving to bring it to room temperature.)
            

Vanilla Frosting:


              In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or with a hand-held electric mixer combine the butter and sugar and mix on low until incorporated. Raise the speed to high and mix until light and fluffy about 10 minutes. (Occasionally turn the mixer off and scrape the sides of the bowl down with a rubber spatula.)
            

              Meanwhile in a small bowl whisk together the milk vanilla lemon juice and zest.
            

              Reduce the speed of the mixer to low. Add the milk mixture in 3 batches waiting for each batch to be fully incorporated before adding the next (scrape the bowl down occasionally). Raise the speed to high and mix briefly until fluffy. Use as desired. May be stored covered in the refrigerator for 3 days.
            

              Yield: about 6 cups

Shrimp and Chive Ravioli with Grape Tomato Sauce Recipe | Tyler Florence | Food Network, 1/2 recipe Pasta Dough for Ravioli recipe follows 1 pound medium-size raw shrimp cleaned and shelled 1 bunch fresh basil leaves plus more for garnish 1 bunch fresh chervil plus more for garnish 1 bunch fresh chives plus more for garnish 1 large egg white plus 1 egg for wash 8 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pint grape tomatoes 2 shallots finely chopped 1/2 bunch fresh chervil plus more for garnish Flour for dusting 5 cups all-purpose flour plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon salt 6 large eggs 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil ,               Make the Pasta Dough for Ravioli and set aside to rest.
            

              Make the filling: In the bowl of a food processor add the shrimp 1/2 bunch basil leaves 1/2 bunch chives 1/2 bunch chervil egg white and 2 tablespoons olive oil; season this with salt and pepper. Pulse until it is finely chopped but not pureed. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
            

              Roll out the dough: Cut the ball of dough in half cover and reserve the piece you are not using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with a little flour. Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine set at the widest setting 2 or 3 times. Guide the dough with your hand as it emerges from the rollers to prevent it from puncturing or stretching. Dust the sheets with extra flour whenever the dough gets sticky. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again 2 or 3 times. Continue reducing the setting and rolling until the machine is at its narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin about 1/8-inch thick for ravioli. Roll out the other half.
            

              Form the ravioli: Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water to make an egg wash. Dust the counter with flour lay out 1 long sheet of pasta and brush the top surface with the egg wash. Drop the filling by the tablespoonful about 2-inches apart onto 1/2 of the pasta sheet. Fold the other 1/2 over the filling like a blanket. Gently press out the air pockets around each mound of filling. Use a sharp knife to cut the sides around each mound and press the edges with your fingers to make a tight seal. Dust a sheet pan with flour to prevent the ravioli from sticking and lay them out to dry slightly while assembling the rest.
            

              Make the sauce: Heat the broiler. Put the tomatoes onto a baking sheet drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Broil until the tomatoes burst about 10 minutes. In a large skillet over medium-high heat add the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil. Put in the shallots and cook them until they are soft about 5 minutes. Chop the remaining basil chives and chervil and add them to the pan. Fold the tomatoes into the pan and cook for another 5 minutes; keep warm while you cook the ravioli.
            

              Cook and sauce the ravioli: Place the pasta into a large pot of boiling salted water and cook for about 4 minutes they'll float to the top when ready; do not overcrowd the pot. Lift them from the water with a large strainer or slotted spoon into the tomato sauce. Gently coat the ravioli with the sauce and serve garnished with more chopped herbs.
            

Pasta Dough for Ravioli:


              To make the pasta dough: In an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook combine the flour and salt. Add the eggs 1 at a time and continue to mix. Pour in 1 tablespoon olive oil and continue to mix until a smooth dough is formed. If the dough is too dry drizzle in a bit of water if it is too wet sprinkle in some more flour. Dust some flour on a work surface knead and fold the dough until it is elastic and smooth this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface of the dough with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.
            

              To make the dough by hand: Combine the flour and salt on a flat work surface shape into a mound and make a well in the center. Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork. Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall and mix it with the beaten eggs. Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall. Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a smooth dough. Dust some flour on the work surface; knead and fold the dough until it is elastic and smooth this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface of the dough with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.

Place the chicken skin side up on the medium side of the grill. Cover and allow the chicken to smoke and grill at the same time. This should take about 15 to 20 minutes. Allow the chicken to cool completely before shredding the meat off the bones. Reserve for the assembling of the nachos.
            

              Form an assembly line with all of the ingredients. Start with the serving dish then the chips chicken tomatoes jalapenos sour cream cilantro and chives.

              Make the pretzels: Warm the milk in a saucepan until it's about 110 degrees; pour into a medium bowl and sprinkle in the yeast. Let the yeast soften about 2 minutes; stir in the brown sugar and 1 cup flour with a wooden spoon. Dice 2 tablespoons butter and soften; stir into the mix. Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups flour and the fine salt to make a sticky dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead adding more flour if needed until smooth but still slightly tacky about 5 minutes. Shape into a ball place in a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size about 1 hour.
            

              Preheat the oven to 450 degrees and grease a large baking sheet. Punch the dough to deflate it then turn out onto a lightly floured surface. (If the dough seems tight cover and let rest until it relaxes.) Divide the dough into 6 pieces. Roll and stretch each piece with the palms of your hands into a 30-inch rope holding the ends and slapping the middle of the rope on the counter as you stretch. Form each rope into a pretzel shape.
            

              Dissolve the baking soda in 3 cups warm water in a shallow baking dish. Gently dip each pretzel in the soda solution then arrange on the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with the coarse salt. Bake until golden 10 to 12 minutes.
            

              Prepare the sauce: Combine the mayonnaise mustard brown sugar and vinegar in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate.
            

              Melt the remaining 8 tablespoons butter in a shallow dish. Dip the hot pretzels in the butter turning to coat; place on a wire rack to let excess butter drip off. Serve the pretzels warm with the sweet mustard sauce.

Barbecue St. Louis Pork Ribs Recipe | Alton Brown | Food Network, 2 teaspoons paprika 1 1/2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 3 slabs St. Louis style ribs 2 to 3 pounds each 4 tablespoons kosher salt 1/3 cup spicy brown mustard , Special equipment: Smoker 4 ounces hickory or oak wood chunks or chips

              Set a smoker to 225 degrees F.
            

              Combine the paprika black peppercorns coriander seeds cumin seeds garlic powder onion powder nutmeg and cayenne in a spice grinder. Process until a fine powder is formed approximately 30 seconds.
            

              Pat the ribs dry and turn bone-side up. Trim excess fat and if one end of the ribs is especially narrow trim meat and bone to ensure even cooking. Remove the membrane on the underside of the ribs by inserting a rounded utensil an upside-down spoon works well between the membrane and the meat at one end of the slab. Carefully work the spoon under the membrane to loosen but not tear. Once enough has been loosened use a paper towel to hold onto the membrane as you slowly pull it down the slab to remove.
            

              Sprinkle the ribs on both sides with the salt and brush both sides with the mustard. Sprinkle two-thirds of the spice mixture on the meat side of the ribs and the remaining third on the bone side.
            

              Once the smoker has reached 225 degrees F add the wood chips or chunks and the ribs to the smoker.
            

              Smoke for 4 to 5 hours then test for doneness. There are four criteria that should be met in order for ribs to be done. First the internal temperature of the meat should be 185 to 190 degrees F. Second pick up each slab from the center with tongs and it should droop into a u-shape and crack slightly. Third while holding with the tongs and bouncing gently the surface of the ribs should crack slightly. Lastly the meat should pull easily off the bone but not fall off. If ribs pass all tests remove them from the smoker and wrap in heavy-duty foil and rest for 15 minutes. If not continue smoking for 45 minutes to 1 hour and test again until done.

Spicy Paneer Fingers with Dates and Almonds Recipe | Aarti Sequeira | Food Network, 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 12 ounces paneer (Indian cheese either store-bought or made from my recipe recipe follows) 1 shallot minced 2 cloves garlic minced 4 dates pitted and chopped 2 cups chicken stock 1 cinnamon stick Hefty pinch of red pepper flakes Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Zest of a lemon Juice of half a lemon 1 tablespoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley 2 tablespoons slivered almonds toasted Naan for serving Cheesecloth 8 cups whole milk 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice plus more as needed see Cook's Note* ,               Grab a large nonstick skillet pour the olive oil into it and pop it over medium-high heat until the oil is shimmering. Carefully lay the paneer into the pan and cook until golden brown on one side 1 or 2 minutes (don't be too hasty to flip it though). If it doesn't release from the pan easily then wait another 30 seconds because it hasn't browned enough.
            

              When the paneer is browned on both sides remove it to a plate.
            

              Add the shallot and garlic; saute until the shallots are soft.
            

              Add the dates chicken stock cinnamon stick and red pepper flakes. Stir together and then return the paneer to the pan. Make sure the liquid is at a gentle simmer. Cover and cook about 5 minutes.
            

              Check for seasoning. Depending on the chicken stock you used you may or may not need to add salt and pepper.
            

              Remove the paneer to a plate and pour the sauce over top. Sprinkle with lemon zest lemon juice parsley and almonds. Serve immediately with a big chunk of naan or bread!
            

Paneer: Homemade Indian Cheese:


              Line a large colander with a large double layer of cheesecloth and set it in your sink.
            

              In a large wide pot bring the milk to a gentle boil over medium heat stirring frequently to avoid burning the bottom (a nonstick pot works really well for this purpose). This will take a little while so be patient!
            

              Add the lemon juice and turn the heat down to low. Stirring gently you should almost immediately see the curds (white milk solids) and whey (the greenish liquid) separate. Don't fret this is perfect!
            

              Remove the pot from the heat and carefully pour the contents into the cheesecloth-lined colander. Gently rinse with cool water to get rid of the lemon flavor. At this point you could squeeze out some of the liquid and serve with some honey and some nuts almost like a fresh ricotta!
            

              Grab the ends of the cheesecloth and twist the ball of cheese to squeeze out the excess whey. Tie the cheesecloth to your kitchen faucet and allow the cheese to drain for about 5 minutes.

              For the dough:
            

              Mix the flour butter sugar and salt quickly with your fingertips until the butter is in pieces about the size of dried beans. Quickly stir the water into the mixture and then gather up the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and press it into a flat dish shape. Refrigerate dough for 1 hour.
            

              Line a cookie sheet or jelly roll pan with parchment or a silicon pad. Roll the dough out onto a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about 15-inches long by 10-inches wide with rough edges. Roll the dough up onto your rolling pin and then unroll it directly onto the lined pan.
            

              Roast the hazelnuts on a cookie sheet for 7 or 8 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a food processor add the 1/4 cup sugar egg 1 tablespoon butter and vanilla and process until a creamy paste forms. Spread the frangipane on the dough stopping about 1 1/2-inches from the outer edge on all sides.
            

              Peel the apples remove the cores and cut them into 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange them attractively in a slightly overlapping pattern like the tiles of a roof on the pastry dough so that the apples cover the frangipane. Fold the edge of the dough back over the apples to make a 1 to 1 1/2-inch border of dough. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar over the apples letting a little of the sugar fall onto the border to help crystallize the dough. Break the remaining 2 tablespoons butter into pieces and scatter them over the tart. Bake for 1 hour. The dough should be nicely crystallized all over.
            

              Remove the finished tart from the oven and cool on a rack until lukewarm. Dilute the apricot preserves with the calvados or water and glaze the surface of the tart spreading it carefully on the apples with the underside of a spoon. Serve at room temperature cut into little wedges with plain cream sour cream creme fraiche or ice cream if desired.

              Make a well from the flour. Add eggs and about 1/2 cup of water. The amount of water will vary according to the weather. You want to make a stiff dough. Divide it into 3 equal portions and knead until silky smooth.
            

              Fillings: We usually make cheese and kapusta (sauerkraut) but you can use meat potatoes or even fruit.
            

Kapusta filling:


              Saute onion in butter until just soft. Add kapusta and brown. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Allow time for the filling to cool before assembling pierogi otherwise they will fall apart when cooked. If making more than one filling this one can cool while you prepare the others.
            

              Mix well.
            

              To assemble and cook pierogi: Roll out a portion (or half portion if space is limited) of the dough on a floured surface as thinly as possible -- somewhere between a wonton and a thin pizza. Put about a tablespoon of filling on the dough and use a large plastic cup (a big gulp-type cup works really well) to cut a circle around the filling. Dampen half of the circumference of the circle with a bit of water on your finger and fold into a dumpling. Boil the dumplings a dozen at a time in a big pot of salted water until they float -- no more than 3 minutes. At this point you can freeze them in bags for later use. To prepare for serving brown the pierogi in a skillet using a bit of butter. If you want to be really traditional you can use bacon grease. Alternately you can bake them in a casserole spraying both the casserole and the pierogi with a butter flavored spray and putting a few pats of butter on top of the dumplings.

              Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Nestle the pork back onto the potatoes and return to the oven. Roast for another 30 minutes.

Reduce the heat in the oven to 350 degrees F and roast for another hour.
            

              To make the glaze:
            

              While the ham is cooking combine the Dijon mustard whole-grain mustard and honey in a small bowl. Remove the ham from the oven and brush it generously with the honey mustard mixture. Return the ham to the oven and roast it for about 30 minutes. Flip it over and brush again with the honey mustard mixture (really slather it on the pork). Roast until it reaches an internal temperature of 150 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer.
            

              Remove the ham from the oven to a cutting board tent it with aluminum foil and let it rest for at least 20 to 30 minutes before slicing.

Braised Short Rib Crostini with Remoulade Recipe | Giada De Laurentiis | Food Network, 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 1/2 pounds boneless beef short ribs cut into 4 pieces 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 carrot peeled and roughly chopped 1 celery stalk roughly chopped 1 onion chopped 3 fresh thyme sprigs 1 bay leaf 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 cup red wine 1 cup beef broth 2 hard-boiled eggs peeled (see Cook's Note) 1/4 cup chopped cornichons (about 7 cornichons) 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon capers chopped 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 16 crostini(see Cook's Note) 4 cornichons sliced thin for garnish , Watch how to make this recipe.


              For the short ribs: Heat the oil in a medium Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the short ribs evenly with the salt and add them to the pan. Sear well on all sides. This will take about 15 minutes total so be patient; the meat should have a deep golden brown color and release evenly from the pan before flipping. Remove the seared short ribs to a plate.
            

              To the hot pan add the carrot celery onion thyme bay leaf and pepper flakes. Cook stirring often with a wooden spoon until very fragrant and beginning to soften about 4 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and caramelize for 2 minutes stirring constantly. Add the red wine and simmer for 5 minutes to reduce slightly. Stir in the beef broth and add the short ribs back to the pan. Bring to a simmer and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer until the meat can be pulled apart with a fork 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Set aside to cool slightly.
            

              Place the short ribs in a medium bowl. Using two forks shred the meat into bite-size pieces. Add about a 1/2 cup of the braising liquid to the meat and toss to moisten.
            

              For the remoulade: In a medium bowl combine the eggs cornichons mayonnaise capers Dijon tarragon salt and pepper. Fold together with a rubber spatula.
            

              For the crostini: Spread a small amount of the remoulade on each of the crostini. Top with a spoonful of the shredded meat and another small dollop of the remoulade. Garnish with a slice of cornichon.

Bugia, or Liar's Cookies Recipe | Michael Chiarello | Food Network, 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour plus more for dusting work surface 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons sugar 2 large eggs 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter melted and cooled briefly 1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice 1 1/2 tablespoons brandy 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3/4 teaspoon ground anise seeds 4 to 6 cups peanut or vegetable oil for deep-frying About 2 cups powdered sugar , Watch how to make this recipe.


              Sift the flour with the baking powder salt and sugar and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment mix together the eggs butter orange juice brandy vanilla and anise seeds until well blended. Add the dry ingredients all at once and mix on low speed until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl and adheres to the paddle.
            

              Remove the dough from the bowl onto a floured board. Knead by hand until smooth. Form the dough into a ball flatten slightly and place in a bowl. Cover with a tea towel and chill at least 2 hours or up to overnight to allow the dough to relax.
            

              Heat the oil in a deep fryer or deep pot to 350 degrees F.
            

              Meanwhile cut the dough into 4 or 6 equal pieces. Keeping the dough and work surface well floured pass the dough through the widest setting of a pasta machine 3 or 4 times. Then pass through successively narrower settings until the dough is almost thin enough to see through; depending on your pasta machine this will probably be the next to thinnest setting.
            

              Cut the dough into long strips 3 inches wide then cut the strips on the diagonal into pieces about 3 inches long. If the dough tears cut it off and work it back into the dough. The cookies curl when they fry so fancier shapes are not important. As the cookies are cut transfer them to baking sheets lined with flour-dusted tea towels and cover with tea towels so they won't dry out before frying. Fry in batches turning once until puffed and golden brown about 1 minute. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.
            

              While the cookies are still hot dust them well with powdered sugar. Wait for a few minutes while the oil and heat absorb and melt most of this first coating. Dust well a second time until the cookies are quite white. The cookies will keep for a week or so in an airtight container. You may need to re-dust them with sugar before serving.
            

              Only a few cookies at a time will fit even in a big pot so frying takes time. It is best to have company in the kitchen ready with lots of good talk to keep you amused. And there are always the warm cookies to eat along the way as a reward. You can also dredge the cookies in granulated sugar crystal sugar or even a mix of powdered sugar and unsweetened cocoa powder.

Sopes Recipe | Food Network, 1 1/2 cups masa harina Scant 1 cup warm water Oil or melted lard for reheating 1/2 cup Frijoles Refritos recipe follows 1 1/2 cups Chorizo y Papa recipe follows 1/2 cup Salsa de Jitomate recipe follows 1 cup finely shredded lettuce or cabbage 1/2 cup finely chopped white onion 1/3 cup finely grated anejo cheese or crumbled queso fresco About 1/3 cup lard melted 1 heated tablespoon finely chopped white onion 3 1/2 cups cooked pinto beans in their broth Approximately 1 tablespoon lard or vegetable oil 1 Mexican chorizo about 3 ounces 6 ounces waxy new potatoes diced and cooked al dente about 1 rounded cup 1 chipotle en adobo chopped Sea salt 2 garlic cloves 4 serrano chiles asado and roughly chopped technique follows Sea salt 1 pound tomatoes asado technique follows About 1/3 cup finely chopped white onion About 1/3 roughly chopped cilantro leaves ,               Put the masa harina in a bowl and add the warm water reserving about 1/4 cup of water until you see how much the flour will absorb.Work well with your hands until smooth. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside in a cool spot for about 1 hour. This gives the starch particles time to swell and absorb the moisture thoroughly giving more flexibility to the dough. Alternatively make the Dried Corn Tortilla Masa (see recipe).
            

              Work the masa until very soft and smooth and divide into 12 equal parts. Roll each into a ball about 1 1/4 inches in diameter and cover with a damp cloth while you work. Warm an ungreased comal over medium heat.
            

              Take 1 of the balls and press out gently in a lined tortilla press or by hand to a disk about 3 1/2 inches; it will be thicker than a tortilla about 1/4-inch. Place carefully on the comal and cook over medium to low heat until the underside is opaque and speckled with brown about 2 minutes. Turn the sope over and cook on the second side for a further 2 minutes. Remove from the comal and immediately (although you may burn your fingers a little) pinch up the dough around the periphery of the sope return it to the comal and cook briefly until the dough is firm and cooked through about 2 minutes more. Continue with the rest of the balls.
            

              Heat a very small amount of the lard or oil in a skillet and let the sopes heat through for about 1/2 minute on each side. Spread with the bean paste and top liberally with the rest of the ingredients. Serve immediately.
            

Refried Beans: Frijoles Refritos:


              Heat the lard in a heavy 10-inch skillet add the onion and fry over medium heat without browning until translucent about 30 seconds. Gradually add the beans and their broth and continue cooking over fairly high heat mashing them down to a paste texture about 10 minutes.
            

Chorizo and Potato Filling: Chorizo y Papa:


              Melt the lard in a small skillet. Skin and crumble the chorizo into the pan and cook over low heat until the fat has been rendered out. Add the potatoes and chile if using and continue cooking over medium heat scraping the bottom of the skillet from time to time to avoid sticking until well seasoned about 8 minutes. Season with salt. Set aside to cool a little before using.
            

Salsa de Jitomate:


              Crush or blend the garlic chiles and salt to a paste. Gradually add the tomatoes (unpeeled) grinding well after each addition. The sauce should be textured and the skin will never all completely disappear.
            

              Sprinkle the top with the onion and cilantro and serve.
            

              Chiles Asado:
            

              Place the whole chilies on an ungreased griddle over medium heat and turn them from time to time until the flesh is fairly soft; there will be brownish patches on the skin and the color will have faded somewhat. Then if they are to be ground with other ingredients chop roughly before blending. *
            

              Tomatoes Asados:
            

              The whole tomatoes are cooked on a ungreased comal or griddle until they are slightly charred and mushy to guarantee a specially delicious table or cooked sauce. About half the cooks I know then skin the tomatoes while others including me blend them unskinned. While the appearance of the sauce may not be as attractive the flavor and texture are incomparable. This method of cooking tomatoes is particularly recommended for freezing and storing for the months when tomatoes are not at their best (not a problem in Mexico).
            

              You may want to broil them in a more practical way. Choose a shallow pan in which the tomatoes will just fit in 1 layer not too large or the juice that is exuded will dry up. (I used to line the pan with foil but no longer. It is high time that we gradually ease foil out of the kitchen or use it very very sparingly. The mining of bauxite for the production of aluminum has destroyed far too many tropical forests on this planet.) Place the pan about 2 inches below a heated broiler and broil until the top halves of the tomatoes are soft and the skin is blistered and slightly browned. Turn the tomatoes over and repeat on the other side. The exuded juice will be sweet and syrupy so save it to blend with the tomatoes.

BASIC PASTA DOUGH:


              Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and the olive oil. Using a fork beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.
            

              As you expand the well keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape. The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.
            

              Start kneading the dough with both hands using the palms of your hands. Once you have a cohesive mass remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits. Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for six more minutes. The dough should be elastic and a little sticky. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Roll or shape as desired.

Perfect Maryland Crab Cakes Recipe | Food Network, 4 slices soft white bread 1 1/2 tablespoons dry white wine 2 cups backfin crabmeat from a refrigerated tin Salt 2 cups jumbo lump crabmeat from a refrigerated tin Maryland Crab Seasoning to taste 2 eggs beaten 1/2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1/8 cup melted unsalted butter 4 tablespoons thick mayonnaise Lard Vegetable oil ,               Trim the crusts from the bread; discard or reserve for another use. Tear the remaining bread into little pieces (about 20 pieces per slice); handle the bread lightly so the pieces remain fluffy and don't flatten out. Place the bread pieces in a bowl and sprinkle them with the wine; toss lightly to distribute the wine evenly.
            

              Pick over the backfin and the jumbo lump crabmeat to remove any bits of shell. In a large mixing bowl toss together the backfin and jumbo lump crabmeat. Season to taste with salt and with Maryland crab seasoning. Add the soaked bread beaten eggs lemon juice and melted butter; toss lightly making sure to keep the crab lumps whole. Add the mayonnaise and toss the mixture gently with your hands distributing the mayonnaise evenly. Taste again for seasoning if desired (if you don't want to taste raw egg you can saute a bit of the mixture in butter). For even better flavor allow the mixture to sit in the refrigerator for a few hours. 
            

              When you are ready to cook place a large heavy-bottomed saute pan over medium-high heat; the pan should have enough room for 3 crab cakes. Add enough lard and vegetable oil (in fifty-fifty production) to create a 1-inch depth of oil. When the oil is medium-hot quickly shape 1/2 the crab mixture with your hands into 3 cakes each roughly the size and shape of a large hamburger. Gently place the cakes in the oil making sure to preserve their shapes. Fry for 3 to 4 minutes or until the cakes are golden on one side. Flip them carefully with a spatula and fry on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes. After about 8 minutes the cakes should be golden brown on all sides and heated through (you want the pieces of bread inside to virtually disappear). Remove the cakes from the pan and place them on paper towels. Repeat and make 3 more cakes with the remaining mixture.

              Whisk the flour salt baking powder baking soda cinnamon ginger cloves pepper and mustard together in a medium bowl.
            

              Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until just combined and lightly fluffy. Beat in the molasses and egg yolk. Gradually add the dry ingredients and mix together on low speed until dough is just combined and still crumbly about 3 minutes. Give dough a few turns with a spatula to bring together.
            

              Lay out wax paper on a clean work surface and put about 1/3 of the batter on top. Lightly press down and top with another sheet of wax paper. Using your hands or a rolling pin gently pat into a rectangle. Roll out with a rolling pin until dough is as thin as possible without breaking no thicker than 1/16 inch thick. This is the key to these cookies: they really can't be too thin. Gently peel back the layer of waxed paper and then replace it loosely.
            

              Transfer rolled batter to a flat baking sheet and freeze until firm and can easily be peeled away from the waxed paper about 30 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough.
            

              Cut dough using a small (2- to 3-inch) fluted round cookie cutter and return to the freezer for 15 minutes to set. Transfer frozen cookies to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake until crisp and lightly evenly colored (but not brown) about 10 minutes.

Chocolate Burritos Recipe | Warren Brown | Food Network, Block of bittersweet chocolate about 1 cup size 1 lemon 1/2 to 1 cup walnuts Granulated sugar 3 to 6 sheets phyllo dough thawed Unsalted butter melted for brushing ,               Note: The amounts for the ingredients are up to the user.
            

              Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
            

              While oven is preheating use a chef's knife to chip chocolate off the block or crush pistoles into small pieces. This is a fun step that creates a lot of chocolate shavings that can be fun for guests to help clean up by eating. The irregular shapes are good too because they create depth of flavor in the final product due to varying masses of chocolate tucked away in the burrito's rolls.
            

              Zest the lemon and set aside. Mincing is not necessary.
            

              Crush the walnuts between your palms or gently break with a rolling pin in a towel. Set aside.
            

              Put granulated sugar in a bowl for sprinkling onto the burrito.
            

              Spread 1 phyllo sheet on a baking sheet and brush with melted butter. Top with another phyllo sheet and brush it with butter. Top with a last sheet but don't butter it on top. I just use 3 sheets but if you like thicker burritos sprinkle on sugar and add 3 more sheets after brushing on the butter.
            

              Sprinkle on chocolate zest and nuts to taste. Be sure to allow room for rolling without bursting the roll. Sugar isn't really necessary inside the roll but a little can be nice.
            

              Roll up the dessert just like a burrito: tuck in sides toward the front then roll up. Also a straight roll like sushi is fine.
            

              Sprinkle phyllo with sugar put on a baking sheet (no greasing or parchment necessary) and bake for 5 to 8 minutes until just barely browned.
            

              Remove wait 5 minutes then cut into bite size pieces with a sharp knife. Serve immediately.

Chicken Stock Recipe | Tyler Florence | Food Network, 1 whole free-range chicken (about 3½ pounds) rinsed giblets discarded 2 carrots cut in large chunks 3 celery stalks cut in large chunks 2 large white onions quartered 1 head of garlic halved 1 turnip halved ¼ bunch fresh thyme 2 bay leaves 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns ,               Place the chicken and vegetables in a large stockpot over medium heat. Pour in only enough cold water to cover (about 3 quarts); too much will make the broth taste weak. Toss in the thyme bay leaves and peppercorns and allow it to slowly come to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low and gently simmer for 1 to 1½ hours partially covered until the chicken is done. As it cooks skim any impurities that rise to the surface; add a little more water if necessary to keep the chicken covered while simmering.
            

              Carefully remove the chicken to a cutting board. When its cool enough to handle discard the skin and bones; hand-shred the meat into a storage container.
            

              Carefully strain the stock through a fine sieve into another pot to remove the vegetable solids. Use the stock immediately or if you plan on storing it place the pot in a sink full of ice water and stir to cool down the stock. Cover and refrigerate for up to one week or freeze.

String Bean and Potato Salad Recipe | Anne Burrell | Food Network, 2 pounds red bliss potatoes 2 garlic cloves peeled and chopped 1/4 to 1/3 cup sherry vinegar 1/4 to 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt 1/2 pound haricots verts stem end removed (hairy end left on) 1/2 cup pitted and slivered gaeta or kalamata olives 1/2 bunch fresh oregano leaves finely chopped 3 scallions white and green thinly sliced on the bias Pinch crushed red pepper flakes , Watch how to make this recipe.


              Put the potatoes and the garlic in a pot of well-salted water to cover and bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Cook until they are "fork" tender about 20 minutes. When the potatoes are tender all the way through remove them from the water and when they are cool enough to handle but still hot carefully cut the potatoes in half. Try not to pull the skins off. Chop the garlic and add it along with 2 tablespoons each vinegar and olive oil and season with salt to taste. It is important to do this while the potatoes are still warm so they will absorb the vinegar and oil and be seasoned all the way through.
            

              While the potatoes are cooking bring another pot of well-salted water to a boil over medium heat. Set up a bowl of ice water and season it generously with salt. Add the beans to the boiling water and cook them until they are tender about 5 to 6 minutes. Bite a bean to be sure they are properly cooked. When the beans are cooked put them immediately in the bowl of salted ice water to stop the cooking or to "shock" them. When they are cold remove them from the water and let them dry a little. Cut them in half.
            

              In a large bowl toss together the potatoes beans olives oregano and scallions and crushed red pepper. Stir to combine well taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. Add the remaining oil and vinegar if needed.
            

              This salad is good now but will be better if you let it sit for at least 1 hour. Enough time to transport it to the game!

Drain and allow to stand until cool enough to handle. Scrape skin from potato with paring knife. Press them through a potato ricer. Spread the riced potatoes into a thin even layer on the work surface and allow to cool completely.
            

              In a small bowl beat together the egg salt pepper and nutmeg. gather cold potatoes into a mound and form a well in the center. Pour egg mixture into the potato well. Knead the potato and egg mixture together with both hands gradually adding the grated cheese and enough of the flour about 1 1/2 cups to form a smooth but slightly sticky dough. It should take no longer than 3 minutes to work the flour into the potato mixture; remember the longer the dough is kneaded the more flour it will require and the heavier it will become. As you knead repeatedly rub dough from hands and scrape it from the work surface back into the dough.
            

              On a flour-dusted surface dust dough and cut it into 6 equal pieces. Form dough into a rope. Slice rope into 1/2-inch thick rounds. Sprinkle rounds with flour and roll them into balls. Hold the tines of a fork at a 45-degree angle to the table with the concave part facing up. Dip the tip of your thumb in flour. Take one ball of dough and with the tip of your thumb press the dough lightly against the tines of the fork as you roll it downward toward the tip of the tines. As the dough wraps around the tip of your thumb it will form into a dumpling. Set on a baking sheet lined with a floured kitchen towel. Repeat with remaining dough. At this point gnocchi must be cooked immediately or frozen.
            

              To cook gnocchi drop into salted boiling water. Cook stirring gently until tender about 1 minute after they rise to the surface of the pot.

Huevos Rancheros Recipe | Tyler Florence | Food Network, 4 medium corn tortillas Peanut oil for deep-frying Salsa Roja recipe follows Chorizo Refried Beans recipe follows 4 large eggs fried sunny side up 1 cup crumbled queso fresco Fresh cilantro sprigs Fried chorizo (reserved from Refried Beans recipe) 4 lime wedges 1 dried ancho chile stemmed and seeded 1 dried Anaheim chile stemmed and seeded 2 dried chipotle chiles stemmed and seeded 1 tablespoon dried oregano preferably Mexican 1 tablespoon cumin seeds 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 1 cup hot water 8 plum tomatoes quartered 1 medium Spanish onion sliced 3 garlic cloves 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 sprigs cilantro 1 tablespoon sugar 1 lime juiced 4 links smoked Mexican chorizo 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 white onion finely diced 2 cloves garlic peeled and chopped 2 (15.5 ounce) cans red kidney beans 1 to 2 cups low-sodium chicken stock Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper , Garnish:


              Heat about 3 inches of peanut oil in a heavy-bottomed pot to 375 degrees F. Preheat the broiler. Fry the tortillas for 30 to 40 seconds until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Dip the tortillas into the Salsa Roja while still hot using tongs and then transfer to serving plates. Top each tortilla with a good spoonful of refried beans and then arrange a sunny side up fried egg on top of the beans. Garnish with crumbled queso fresco Salsa Roja cilantro fried chorizo and lime wedges.
            

Salsa Roja:


              Tear all the chiles into large pieces and toast them in a large dry skillet over medium heat until they change color a bit about 2 minutes. Add the spices and continue to toast for 2 to 3 minutes until everything is fragrant. Remove from heat and carefully add about 1 cup of hot water to just cover the chiles. Turn the heat to low and simmer for about 15 minutes.
            

              Preheat the broiler. Put the quartered tomatoes sliced onion and whole garlic cloves onto a roasting tray spreading out evenly. Drizzle with plenty of olive oil and season well with salt and pepper and sprinkle with cilantro sprigs. Broil until everything is nicely charred about 10 minutes (you want lots of deep rich color so don't be afraid if some of the edges get pretty black).
            

              Add the chile mixture to a blender and puree. Remove the tomato/onion mixture from the roasting pan and carefully add it to the blender (it will be hot). Blend until smooth (you may need to work in 2 batches). Once everything is pureed pour the mixture back into the pot over low heat adding a little water if the salsa is too thick. Stir in the sugar and lime juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside until ready to use.
            

Chorizo Refried Beans:


              Finely chop the chorizo into small dice. In a heavy-bottomed pot add olive oil and chorizo. Put the pot over low heat and slowly bring the heat up to medium. Fry the chorizo for a few minutes to infuse the olive oil. Using a slotted spoon remove about 1/4 cup of chorizo for garnish and set aside. To the remaining chorizo in the pot add the onion and garlic and fry until both are cooked about 2 minutes. Add the beans with their liquid and stock and simmer to allow the flavors to come together about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Use a potato masher to mash the beans into a coarse puree. Alternatively you could let the beans cool for about 5 minutes and carefully puree in a food processor until smooth. Set aside until ready to use.

Wild Mushroom Ravioli with Eggplant and Goat Cheese Recipe | Rachael Ray | Food Network, 1 to 1 1/4 pounds eggplant: 4 (5 to 6-inch) Japanese eggplant or 1 small firm eggplant 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 turns of the pan 3 cloves garlic chopped Salt and pepper 1 (12-ounce) package fresh wild mushroom ravioli 2 medium vine ripe tomatoes about 8 ounces 8 ounces goat cheese to crumble 1 cup 20 leaves fresh basil leaves torn or shredded ,               Place a pot of water on the stove to boil for pasta.
            

              Trim half of the skin from the eggplant. Leaving a little skin on will add color and texture to the dish. The small firm eggplants are not too bitter and when they are firm they will not soak up as much oil so they do not need to be salted and pressed. However if you leave all the skin especially when you use baby eggplant the skin overpowers the flavor of the flesh and the texture is too tough overall.
            

              Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cut the eggplant into 1-inch-by-1/2 inch bite size pieces. Add 2 turns of extra-virgin olive oil to the pan the garlic and the eggplant. Turn and toss the eggplant and season it with salt and pepper. Let it brown lightly at edges about 5 minutes then reduce heat to medium low and continue to cook.
            

              Add salt and ravioli to the pasta water and simmer to package directions about 5 or 6 minutes until just tender.
            

              While the pasta cooks dice tomatoes and add them to the cooking eggplant. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
            

              Drain cooked pasta and plate individually or on a platter. Top with eggplant and tomatoes and all of the basil and cheese. If you plate individually use 1/4 of the basil and 2 ounces of cheese crumbled per portion.

Sunny's Insta Huevos Rancheros Recipe | Sunny Anderson | Food Network, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 8 jumbo eggs 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 pound Mexican chorizo casings removed 1/2 cup chopped Vidalia onions Kosher salt Pinch of cumin 1 clove garlic minced One 16-ounce can refried beans 6 to 8 pickled jalapeno slices finely chopped Pickled jalapeno juice optional Eight 6-inch corn tortillas Shredded Monterey Jack for serving Pico de gallo for serving Kosher salt and freshly cracked coarse black pepper Chopped fresh cilantro for serving Lime wedges for serving Hot sauce for serving , Watch how to make this recipe.


              Make the eggs: In a large nonstick pan or two medium nonstick pans add the butter (do the division if using 2 pans). Turn the pan on low and allow the butter to gently melt without browning. Once it is melted tilt and swirl the pan to coat the bottom and the sides (this will help you slide the eggs out later).
            

              Ok pay close attention: We are going to Frankenyolk these eggs. That means you'll make one egg have two yolks. (If you get lucky and get a double-yolk jumbo egg go buy a lottery ticket.) Crack one egg into the pan. Then separate the second egg over a bowl leaving just the yolk in one side of the shell and the whites in the bowl. Take the yolk in the shell and using the edge of the shell gently break the thick clear albumen (egg white) of the egg already in the pan and pour the separated yolk right next to the other yolk. Keep the yolks next to each other so they cook at the same time. Repeat this process with the rest of the eggs so you have 4 eggs with 2 yolks each. What to do with the whites? Make an egg white omelet the next day if you feel guilty. If not how about a meringue pie for dessert tonight? Haaaiii!!
            

              Cook the eggs on medium-low heat until the whites are cooked through and the yolks are still runny. This takes a good 8 to 10 minutes so be patient and work on the other steps. Brown edges on a fried egg are just wrong in my book. If the eggs finish before the other steps just remove the pan(s) from the heat.
            

              Cook the refried beans: In a medium pot add the oil and chorizo and cook on medium heat using a wavy potato masher or wooden spoon to break the chorizo into bits to create crumbles like ground beef. Once the orange fat is rendered add the onions a tiny pinch of salt and cumin and the garlic and cook stirring them into the chorizo. When the onions are tender and stained with the fat of the chorizo add the refried beans and chopped pickled jalapenos. Cook until the beans are softened and loose. If they dry up a bit add a splash of water or if you are feeling slightly dangerous add a bit of the pickling juice from the jalapenos. Keep warm.
            

              Char the tortillas: In a large dry pan (cast-iron please) or griddle over high heat add the stack of tortillas. Cook and flip in a way that once the bottom tortilla is charred it moves to the top of the stack flipped. Continue to flip and alternate sides until each tortilla has had a date with the bottom of the pan. Time to build your plate!
            

              Build your plate: Place equal amount of the refried beans on each plate. Slightly level them out with the back of your spoon. Sprinkle each with an equal amount of cheese and then slide a double-yolk sunny-side up egg on top. Sprinkle some pico de gallo around the edges so you don't mess with the yolks. Season each yolk with salt and a crack of black pepper. Sprinkle the entire plate with cilantro and spritz with lime juice and a shake of hot sauce. Serve each plate with 2 folded charred tortillas.

Grilled Pork Chops with Sauteed Apples, Onion Rings and Mustard Greens Recipe | Elizabeth Falkner | Food Network, 3 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 1 teaspoon pimenton 4 whole cloves 1 teaspoon light brown sugar 3 bone-in center-cut pork chops (10 to 12 ounces each) Sauteed Apples: 2 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1 Granny Smith apple cored and sliced into 1/4-inch-thick slices 1 whole star anise 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 2 tablespoons brandy Salt 2 cups canola oil for frying 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup cornstarch 1/2 teaspoon salt plus more as needed A few grinds of black pepper 1/2 cup buttermilk 1 large yellow onion sliced into 1/2-inch rings and separated Mustard greens for serving , Watch how to make this recipe.


              There are rubs and there are brines. A brine is a slower process where the rub sugar and salt are diluted to penetrate the protein and break it down so that the meat is juicy flavorful and tender after cooked. I love brined pork and chicken but if I am cooking late and didn't think about it the day before I will have to do a nice rub on the meat which is just more concentrated and expedited and that's what I have here. Pork chops go with so many accompaniments but I do love the acidity of apples or an applesauce with pork chops and the bite of mustard greens. You can use mizuna or arugula if you cannot find mustard greens. Also you can put a schmear of hot mustard mixed with a little honey or molasses on the plate instead for the kick. I like onion rings in general. My other favorite accompaniment to pork chops is kimchee tossed with some fresh fruit such as peaches or plums.
            

              To cook the pork chops: Grind all the spices together with the sugar and rub all over the pork chops. Set aside for 30 minutes to an hour at room temperature.
            

              Preheat the grill on high or heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat on the stovetop and preheat the oven to 375 degrees (Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan if cooking in cast iron).
            

              Cook the pork on one side for 4 to 5 minutes on the grill or in cast iron. Flip over and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes on the grill; if cooking in cast iron flip the chop and transfer to the oven for 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes.
            

              To cook the sauteed apples: In a medium saute pan over medium-high heat combine the sugar 1 tablespoon water and a drop of lemon juice. Cook until sugar caramelizes to golden brown. Turn off the heat and add the apple slices and star anise. Return the pan to medium-high heat stir in the butter and remaining lemon juice. Saute stirring for 2 minutes adding the brandy in the last minute of cooking with a pinch of salt. Simmer briefly to burn off the alcohol and thicken the caramel. Set aside.
            

              To cook the onion rings: Bring the canola oil to 360 degrees F in a large pot. Combine the flour cornstarch salt and pepper in a bowl. Pour the buttermilk into a shallow dish or bowl. Dip the onion rings in the flour mixture to dredge shaking off any excess. Dip in the buttermilk to coat and then back into the flour mixture. Shake off any excess flour. Working in batches fry the rings until light golden brown 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt.
            

              Serve the pork chops with the sauteed apples onion rings and mustard greens.

              With a very sharp knife cut the chicken breasts in half down the middle. This will result in 8 chicken breast pieces that are thinner and uniform in size.
            

              Next make the marinade. In a large bowl mix together the honey mustard paprika salt pepper to taste lemon juice and crushed red pepper flakes if using. Stir to combine.
            

              Add the chicken to the marinade and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge 2 to 4 hours.
            

              While the chicken marinates fry up the bacon until chewy. When finished cooking reserve 1/4 cup of the bacon grease and pour off the rest of the grease (but do not clean the skillet).
            

              When you are ready to cook the chicken remove it from the marinade and cook it in the skillet over medium-high heat 3 to 4 minutes each side. Brush a little reserved bacon grease on the chicken as you cook it. (Or you can grill the chicken breasts on an indoor or outdoor grill.)
            

              When a couple of minutes grilling time are left lay 2 pieces of bacon onto each chicken breast. Top with some Cheddar and allow it to melt on the grill (if you need to remove the chicken you can finish melting the cheese under the broiler).
            

              Halve the rolls and immediately load with the bacon-and-cheese covered chicken.

Tagine of Lamb Stracotto with Spring Onions Recipe | Michael Chiarello | Food Network, 3 pounds lamb shoulder cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes 4 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves chopped fine 15 peeled garlic cloves lightly crushed 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 2 1/4 pounds Yukon gold creamer potatoes (small) halved 1 1/2 pounds medium-sized carrots peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces 1/4 cup olive oil 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups red wine 7 1/2 cups chicken stock (if using canned use low sodium) 2 sprigs fresh rosemary about 3-inches long 2 cups spring onions root and stem trimmed 2 tablespoons Italian parsley leaves chopped fine 1 tablespoon lemon zest Salt and freshly ground black pepper ,               Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
            

              Toss the lamb with the rosemary garlic oil and the vinegar and let marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
            

              While the lamb is marinating blanch the potatoes and carrots. In well-salted boiling water cook the potatoes for 5 or 6 minutes then transfer with a skimmer to a platter or sheet tray. Cook the carrots for 2 or 3 minutes and reserve with the potatoes.
            

              Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan on medium-high heat until the oil begins to smoke. While the oil is heating remove the lamb from the marinade and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the lamb with the flour and toss to coat. Shake excess flour from the meat and add half to the pan in a single layer so as to sear the meat on all sides about 2 minutes on each side. Remove to a plate. Repeat with remaining lamb.
            

              Carefully place the potatoes and carrots in the pan used for the lamb. (The olive oil will have lots of flavor from the lamb.) Season with salt and pepper and saute until lightly caramelized about 4 minutes. Stir from time to time and regulate the heat so the vegetables do not caramelize too much on one side. Transfer to a platter or large plate so that they can be spread out in a single layer.
            

              Pour off and discard the residual oil in the pan. With the pan still on medium heat deglaze with the wine and reduce by half then add the stock. Bring to a simmer and reduce again by half. Add the seared lamb to the pan and gently toss to incorporate with the pan sauce. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.
            

              In a Dutch oven or large deep baking dish add the lamb wine and broth mixture and rosemary. Cover then place in the pre-heated oven for 45 minutes.
            

              Add the potatoes carrots and spring onions to the stew. Mix carefully to incorporate. Add a little stock or water if necessary to keep the stew moistened. Continue to cook in the oven covered until the meat and vegetables are tender about 10 more minutes.
            

              Stir in the parsley and lemon zest. Taste and add salt and fresh ground pepper if needed. Serve directly from the baking dish.

Cavatelli with Glazed Vegetables Recipe | Food Network Kitchen | Food Network, 2 cups all-purpose flour plus more for dusting Kosher salt 1/4 pound (1 1/2 cups) ricotta cheese 1 large egg lightly beaten 2 bunches scallions cut into 2-inch lengths 6 to 8 small radishes quartered lengthwise 8 ounces thin asparagus cut into 2-inch pieces 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter diced Freshly ground pepper ,               Combine the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl; make a well in the center. Add 1 cup ricotta and the egg to the well; gradually mix into the flour with a fork to form a shaggy dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead into a smooth ball. Wrap in a kitchen towel and set aside for 30 minutes.
            

              Meanwhile blanch the vegetables: Prepare a bowl of salted ice water. Bring a medium saucepan of generously salted water to a boil. Add the scallions; boil until bright green about 30 seconds. Transfer with a slotted spoon to the ice water. Boil the radishes then the asparagus cooking each until bright but still firm 2 to 3 minutes then plunging into the ice water. Drain the vegetables and set aside.
            

              On a clean dry surface form the cavatelli (see instructions below).
            

              Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the cavatelli; cook until they float and are tender 3 to 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl (reserve the pasta water) and toss with 2 tablespoons butter and salt and pepper to taste. Cover to keep warm.
            

              Melt another 2 tablespoons butter with 3 to 4 tablespoons pasta water in a skillet over medium heat. Add the vegetables; toss until warm and glazed. Season with salt and pepper. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and more pasta water to make a light sauce. Toss with the cavatelli; serve topped with dollops of the remaining 1/2 cup ricotta.
            

              Cavatelli:
            

              1. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Work with one piece of dough at a time; cover the rest with a towel.
            

              2. Roll the dough into a long 1/2 inch-thick rope working from the center to the edges to maintain an even thickness as you go.
            

              3. Cut the rope into 1/4-inch-wide pieces (we used a pastry scraper) pressing down and pushing away with each cut so the piece curls slightly.

Levain Bakery Oatmeal Raisin Scones Recipe | Food Network, 3 cups all-purpose flour plus more for the counter 2 1/2 cups rolled oats 3/4 cup white sugar 2 tablespoons baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 12 ounces sweet butter cold and diced small 1 cup golden raisins 1 1/2 cups half-and-half ,               Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              Combine everything except the half-and-half until just combined. Do not over mix. (Mixture will not be creamed just mixed together.)
            

              Quickly pour in 1 1/4 cups of the half-and-half while mixing quickly. If the dough appears at all dry add the remaining 1/4 cups of half & half until just combined. Again do not over mix.
            

              Turn the dough out onto a very well floured surface. If the dough is very sticky flour the top of the dough also. Pat the mixture into a layer 3/4 to 1-inch thick. Using a 2-inch diameter round cutter cut out the scones dipping the cutter into flour each time between cuts. Place each scone as cut onto a parchment paper covered sheet pan leaving 2 to 3 inches between each scone. This should make 12 round scones. (You can also form dough into rectangular shape and cut with a knife into 12 square or triangle scones.)
            

              Bake for about 18 minutes or until golden brown on both the top and bottom of scones.

Sauteed Salmon with Red Onion Marmalade Recipe | Food Network, 4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets skin on Salt and freshly ground black pepper Peanut oil 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon oil 2 red onions cut into 1-inch dice 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 3 tablespoons red wine 3 sprigs fresh thyme 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon butter Chive flowers as garnish ,               Season the salmon with salt and pepper on both sides. Make 2 or 3 slits across the skin of the salmon. Place a cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add enough peanut oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Just as the oil begins to smoke add the salmon skin-side down and cook for 4 minutes. Lower the heat and cook the salmon all the way on the same side about 10 minutes - it will cook from the bottom up. During the last 30 seconds or so spoon some of the oil over the top of the salmon to help cook it through.
            

              While the salmon is cooking make the sauce. In a stainless steel saute pan over medium heat add 1 tablespoon butter and the oil. When the butter is melted add the onions and cook until translucent but not browned about 6 minutes stirring constantly. Season with salt and pepper. Deglaze with the balsamic vinegar and red wine. Add the thyme and cook until the liquid is almost completely reduced about 3 minutes. Add the cream and bring to a simmer. Cook until the cream is slightly reduced and starts to thicken about 3 to 4 minutes stirring occasionally. Be careful as the cream could boil over at this point. Once the cream is reduced remove the thyme sprig. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the remaining butter.
            

              Spoon the onion marmalade onto plates. Top with the salmon and garnish with chive flowers.

Spaghetti with Tomato and Basil Recipe | Scott Conant | Food Network, 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 20 ripe plum tomatoes peeled and seeded Pinch crushed red pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 fresh basil leaves chiffonade 1 pound spaghetti 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1-ounce freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (about 2 tablespoons) ,               In a wide pan over medium-high heat heat 1/3 cup of olive oil until quite hot. Add the tomatoes red pepper flakes and season lightly with the salt and pepper. (I always start with a light hand with the salt and pepper because as the tomatoes reduce the salt will become concentrated.) Using a potato masher mash the tomatoes finely. (This will be easier to do as the tomatoes begin to heat up.) Cook the tomatoes for 20 to 25 minutes until the tomatoes are tender and the sauce has thickened.
            

              Meanwhile stack and roll the basil leaves into a cylinder and cut thinly crosswise into a chiffonade.
            

              Bring a large pot of amply salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti until just shy of al dente. Reserve a little of the pasta cooking water. Add the pasta to the sauce and cook over medium-high heat gently tossing the pasta and the sauce together with a couple of wooden spoons and a lot of exaggerated movement (you can even shake the pan) until the pasta is just tender and the sauce if any oil had separated from it now looks cohesive. (If the sauce seems too thick add a little pasta cooking liquid to adjust it.) Take the pan off of the heat and toss the butter basil and cheese with the pasta in the same manner (the pasta should take on an orange hue) and serve immediately.
            

              Cook's Note: Here is a good tip for peeling and seeding tomatoes: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Have a large bowl of ice water nearby. Cut a small shallow X on the bottom of each tomato. Ease about 5 tomatoes into the pot and cook for about 15 seconds and then promptly move them to the ice water. (Do this with the remaining tomatoes.) Pull off the skin with the tip of a paring knife. If the skin sticks try a vegetable peeler using a gentle sawing motion. Cut the tomatoes in half and use your finger to flick out the seeds.

Spicy Shrimp Tempura Recipe | Beau MacMillan | Food Network, 1 cup white medium-grain rice such as Calrose One 13.5-ounce can coconut milk 1 1/2 red bell peppers diced 1 jalapeno sliced with seeds 1 cup sugar 1/4 cup cider vinegar 1 to 2 pinches red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon liquid pectin 1 avocado sliced 1 cucumber seeded and sliced 1 fresh mango chopped 1/4 of a fresh jalapeno sliced 6 sprigs fresh cilantro plus more for garnish 3 green onions chopped plus more for garnish 1 tablespoon sugar 1 tablespoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar 1 teaspoon chili paste Pinch black pepper 8 large shrimp or tiger prawns 1 1/2 cups rice flour 1 1/2 to 2 cups carbonated water Canola oil for frying , Watch how to make this recipe.


              For the sticky rice: Wash the rice until the water is clear and all the starch is washed off. Put the rice in a shallow cooking pan and add the coconut milk and 3/4 cup water. (Trick - place your hand flat in the pan and pour in the water. When the liquid reaches your middle finger knuckle you have the right amount.)
            

              Bring the rice and coconut milk to a boil. Then turn down the heat to low cover the pan and simmer for 15 minutes.
            

              For the jelly: Put the bell peppers jalapeno sugar cider vinegar and red pepper flakes into a saucepan and cook over medium heat until the liquid is reduced by two-thirds. Add the liquid pectin to give it a jelly-like consistency. Then set aside.
            

              For the salad: Combine the avocado cucumber mango jalapeno cilantro green onions sugar oil vinegar chili paste and black pepper in a bowl and mix together.
            

              For the shrimp: Peel and clean the shrimp. I like to use tiger prawns - big daddy shrimp!! Frozen shrimp is fine - just let them thaw out and rinse them in water.
            

              Whisk together the rice flour and carbonated water until it reaches a batter consistency (alternatively you can get premade tempura batter at Asian markets). It's key to not whisk too much you want a nice fine batter without much air in it.
            

              Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Next take a heavy-bottomed pot and fill it with canola oil. Don't fill the pot too much! If using a 1-gallon saucepot use 1/4 gallon oil. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it's about 350 degrees F. You can test if the oil is ready by dropping some of the tempura batter into the oil. If it floats to the top it's ready to go!
            

              Dredge the shrimp in the batter and drop into the oil. The shrimp will cook all the way in 2 to 3 minutes. It's key to not add too many shrimp at once just add 3 or 4 at a time.
            

              When the shrimp floats to the top they should be done. You can test them by taking one out and cutting into it to make sure it's opaque and then taking a bite. Place the shrimp in the oven until you are ready to plate.
            

              Combine all the components: Put the fried shrimp in a bowl with some pepper jelly and toss to coat them. Next take a little bit of the jelly and place on the bottom of each plate. Put some sticky rice down on the plate on top of the jelly. Place 2 shrimp on top of the rice. Add some mango and avocado salad. Garnish with a little extra cilantro or sliced green onions.

Lamb Kebabs with Pomegranate Glaze Recipe | Aarti Sequeira | Food Network, 1 pound ground lamb 3 quarter-size slices ginger 2 large cloves garlic or 4 small 2 medium shallots Zest of 1 lemon and separately its juice 4 sprigs fresh mint Handful fresh cilantro 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 4 tablespoons pomegranate molasses 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon garam masala optional Lots of freshly ground pepper Oil for drizzling 1 cup plain yogurt 2 tablespoons minced fresh mint 1 large English cucumber grated 1 clove garlic minced Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper , Special equipment: Food processor if you have it 8 bamboo skewers stovetop griddle or big nonstick pan or outside grill

              For the lamb: Bring the lamb to room temperature. If you're going to cook your kebabs on the grill soak bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes so they don't burn. Grab your food processor. You can chop all this by hand too; just make sure to chop it all up very finely. Throw the ginger garlic shallots lemon zest mint cilantro and salt into the processor. Grind until very finely chopped. Throw the lamb into a big bowl. Add the shallot mixture 2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses baking soda garam masala if using and pepper to the meat. Using your hands knead 2 to 5 minutes until the meat lightens in color taking on the appearance of knitted fabric. It will also be very sticky. Perfect! Divide the meat in half then in half again and then half again until you have 8 mounds. Have a platter ready for your completed kebabs. Drizzle a little oil on the platter so the kebabs don't stick. Have your bamboo skewers standing by. Take one ball of meat and roll it into a short stump. Thread the skewer through it and then begin shaping the kebab with quick strokes pulling the meat down. It should be a little over 1/4-inch thick. Roll the kebab between your hands to seal the meat. Repeat. Preheat a griddle over medium heat drizzling oil over it so that when it starts to smoke you'll know it's ready. Meanwhile mix the juice of half the lemon with the remaining 2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses in a small bowl. When it's hot place the skewers on the grill. Cook about 2 minutes then turn a quarter of the way. Brush with the lemon-molasses glaze and cook another 2 minutes. Continue in this way until you've cooked the meat 8 to 10 minutes.
            

              For the raita: Mix the yogurt mint cucumber and garlic together. Season with salt and pepper and serve alongside the kebabs.

Line two 12-cup muffin pans with cupcake liners and set aside.
            

              Crack the eggs into a small container and set aside. Set the sugar aside. Then in a small bowl mix the gluten-free flour nutmeg and salt together with a fork and set aside.
            

              In the bowl of a stand mixer on medium speed beat the butter with a paddle attachment until the butter is light in color and fluffy. Add the sugar to the butter and continue beating until the sugar is uniformly incorporated into the butter. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Then restart the mixer on low speed and add 1 egg at a time waiting until it is fully incorporated in the butter mixture before adding the next egg.
            

              Once all the eggs have been added stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure that all the butter is incorporated with the eggs. Add the dry ingredients in three additions alternating with the milk and oil added in two additions fully incorporating each addition into the batter before moving to the next step. If needed stop the mixer after each addition and scrape down the sides of the bowl and then resume mixing on low. Once all the dry ingredients and the milk have been combined with the butter mixture evenly fill the cupcake pan cavities two-thirds of the way. Bake the cupcakes until the top of each cupcake is slightly springy to the touch and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean 14 to 16 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately turn the cupcakes out of the pan onto a cooling rack. Let the cupcakes cool completely.
            

              Putting it all together: Using an apple corer or knife core the centers out of the cooled cupcakes and remove. Fill the cupcakes with the Vanilla Bean Pastry Cream. Pipe the Dark Chocolate Italian Meringue Buttercream to cover the top of each cooled cupcake.
            

Vanilla Bean Pastry Cream:


              Bring the shallow dish or container for the finished pastry cream near the stovetop and have the plastic wrap nearby as well. Measure the butter and vanilla bean paste into a small container and bring over near the stovetop. Pour the milk and 1/4 cup sugar into a heavy saucepot and scald over medium heat until the milk starts to steam. Do not boil the milk!
            

              Meanwhile whisk together the cornstarch and the remaining 1/4 cup sugar to combine and prevent any lumps in the cornstarch and then add the whole egg and egg yolks. Whisk the egg yolk mixture until smooth and completely combined and then bring over to the stove area and set the bowl with the yolks on top of a damp dish towel.
            

              When the milk is steaming remove from the heat. Whisking the egg yolk mixture constantly slowly pour the milk in a steady stream into the egg yolk mixture. Once all the milk is combined with the egg yolk mixture pour it back into the saucepot and return to medium-high heat whisking constantly. Continue whisking and bring it to a boil. Let the egg yolk mixture boil for 1 minute (and continue whisking constantly so lumps don't form!) and then remove from the heat. Stir in the butter and vanilla bean paste and then pour the entire contents of the pot into the shallow dish.
            

              Immediately cover the surface of the pastry cream with the plastic wrap and refrigerate until cool about 1 hour. Once cool remove from the refrigerator and whisk until completely smooth and lump free. Fill a piping bag with the pastry cream and set aside until you need it.
            

Dark Chocolate Italian Meringue Buttercream:


              Measure the sugar and 1/4 cup water into a heavy saucepan and heat over high heat until the sugar mixture reaches 250 degrees F 15 to 20 minutes (use a candy thermometer to gauge the temperature).
            

              While the sugar is cooking beat the egg whites on medium speed in the mixing bowl of a stand mixture to the soft peak stage (whites will look foamy and white). Be careful not to over whip the whites (if the egg whites start to look clumpy then they've been over whipped. If this happens toss them out and start again! If the whites are beating faster than the sugar is cooking turn down the mixer speed. You can always turn up the speed if you need to!) Add the cream of tartar and continue whipping.
            

              While the egg whites are whipping on medium speed gently pour the sugar syrup down the side of the mixing bowl. Turn the speed up to high and whip until the mixing bowl no longer feels warm to the touch about 7 minutes.
            

              Meanwhile melt the dark chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl at 30 second intervals stirring in between each interval until the chocolate is completely melted.
            

              Turn the mixer speed back to medium and add the butter in small chunks until it is completely incorporated. Stop the mixer scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the vanilla bean paste and sea salt. Turn the mixer back on medium-low speed until the vanilla paste has mixed entirely through the buttercream. Spoon a small amount (about 1/2 cup) of the buttercream into the melted dark chocolate and stir to combine. Add the chocolate mixture back to the buttercream and whip thoroughly stopping the mixer to scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure all the chocolate is combined.
            

              Fit an 18-inch plastic piping bag with an 847 star tip and twist the bag right by the tip to prevent the buttercream from leaking out. While you grasp the piping bag right above the star tip with your hand fold the top of the piping bag over your hand and spoon the butter cream into the piping bag.

Green Chile Chicken Recipe | Ree Drummond | Food Network, 1/2 cup olive oil 3 tablespoons lime juice 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce or more to taste 2 cloves garlic 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts 6 poblano chiles 8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese cut into 6 slices , Watch how to make this recipe.


              First make the marinade for the chicken: Combine the olive oil lime juice cumin salt pepper chipotle peppers and garlic in a blender and mix until totally pureed. Pour into a large resealable plastic bag with the chicken breasts. Seal the bag smush it around to coat the chicken and place it in the fridge to marinate for at least 4 hours (overnight if possible).
            

              After the chicken has marinated roast the poblano chiles one-by-one over the flame of your stovetop using metal tongs to hold them until the skin is totally charred. (If you don't have a gas stove you can use an outdoor grill OR place them on a baking sheet directly under your oven's broiler.) When the skin is totally blackened place the chiles in a large resealable plastic bag and seal the bag to allow the chiles to sweat for a good 20 minutes. Remove the chiles and use a knife to scrape off most of the blackened skin. Slice the chiles in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds and membranes. Lay out the chile halves so they'll be ready for the next step.
            

              Preheat a grill pan to medium-high heat (or use a skillet). Grill the chicken (or saute in the skillet) for 4 minutes on the first side. Turn the chicken over and lay 2 chile halves and a nice slice of cheese on the cooked side of each piece. Turn the heat to medium low and allow the chicken to finish cooking until it's totally done in the center 4 to 5 minutes. The cheese should melt on its own; if it needs a little help invert an iron skillet over it (or put the lid on the skillet if using). Serve!

              Squeeze the lime juice (from the now cooled lime) through the feed opening of a running blender. With the blender still running add the vinegar corn syrup shallot and rosemary 1 at a time and pour the oil in a slow steady stream into the vinegar mixture very slowly to emulsify. Remove to a container and season with salt and pepper to taste.
            

              For the spring greens:
            

              Tear the greens into bite-sized pieces and remove the stems if using arugula. (Make sure greens are no longer wet from being rinsed.) Toss greens with Parmesan season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside.
            

              For the filling:
            

              Heat the clarified butter over medium heat in a large saute pan. Add the onion and cook for about 15 minutes until translucent and beginning to caramelize then add the portobellos and white mushrooms to the onions. Cook for another 10 minutes then reduce heat to low and add the tomatoes chives salt and pepper and allow flavors to integrate.
            

              For the vol-au-vent (tart pastry):
            

              Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
            

              Roll out puff pastry dough and using a 4-inch circle cutter (aka biscuit cutter) cut out 8 dough rounds. Place 4 of the dough rounds on a lightly greased baking sheet. Using a 3-inch circle or biscuit cutter cut a concentric circle in the middle of the remaining 4-inch dough rounds to create a 1/2-inch wide circle of dough. These 1/2-inch wide circles of dough are to be used without the 3-inch pieces from the center. Place 1 of these 1/2-inch wide circles of dough on top of each of the rounds already on the baking sheet matching up the edges. Brush egg wash over the surface of each of the paired dough circles and rounds. Then use a fork to prick through the dough around the perimeter (that is through each dough circle and into the accompanying round beneath it). Place in the oven and bake until golden brown about 6 to 8 minutes. The center of each will rise. Remove pastry shells from oven and allow to cool slightly.
            

              Using the tip of a butter knife break through the risen center part of each pastry shell to make a crater. Spoon some of the mushroom mixture into each of these craters. Place some greens on top of each tart and drizzle with lime balsamic vinaigrette.

Omelet with Fines Herbes Recipe | Alex Guarnaschelli | Food Network, 3 eggs lightly beaten room temperature 1 teaspoon tepid water 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Hot sauce to taste Worcestershire sauce to taste 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon washed dried and chopped parsley leaves 1 small bunch chives minced 1 tablespoon washed dried and chopped tarragon leaves Buttered toast slices , Watch how to make this recipe.

Special equipment: 6-inch nonstick skillet

              In a bowl whisk together the eggs water salt a couple of dashes of hot sauce and a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Whisk only enough to integrate the eggs. You dont want to whip too much air into them or make them frothy. Put the skillet over medium heat and add the butter. Swirl the butter around as it melts so it coats the whole surface of the pan. When the butter is melted (but not browned) lower the heat and pour in the egg mixture. Use a fork to stir the eggs slightly as if you were scrambling them. Then allow the eggs to cook undisturbed for about 15 to 30 seconds. Sprinkle the herbs over the eggs.
            

              Lift the handle of the pan up tilting the pan away from you and towards the heat. This tilting should cause the omelet to slide down in the pan a little. Fold the edge closest to you towards the center. Fold the other edge towards the center and tilt the pan over the center of a plate so it lands seam side down. Serve immediately with buttered toast slices.

Italian Springtime Lamb Recipe | Giada De Laurentiis | Food Network, One 5-pound trimmed and boned leg of lamb butterflied 3 tablespoons olive oil 6 cloves garlic minced 4 sprigs fresh rosemary leaves removed and chopped 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1/2 cup chopped walnuts One 5-ounce container baby spinach leaves roughly chopped 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 3/4 cup raisins 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup whole-grain mustard 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs 1/3 cup coarsely chopped fresh Italian parsley 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest (from 1 large lemon) 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt , Watch how to make this recipe.


              For the lamb: Remove the lamb from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking.

              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              Spread the lamb out flat fat-side down on a board in front of you. If it is still very thick gently pound it to an even 1-inch thickness. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and the 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Spread evenly with the mustard; distribute the spinach mixture over the mustard.

              Mix together the brown sugar flour cinnamon and nutmeg in a small bowl. In another bowl sprinkle apples with the juice and zest of 1 lemon and toss. Stir in the sugar mixture to evenly coat the apples.
            

              Set aside. Roll out chilled dough into 2 circles and use 1 round to line a 9-inch pie pan. Chill the other round.
            

              Mound the apple and sugar mixture into the pie pan lined with dough. Dot with the cubed butter.
            

              Using a pastry cutter cut an even number of strips from the remaining rolled out dough. Transfer every other strip to the pie top and weave in the lattice by folding every other strip back onto itself and laying another strip perpendicularly. Fold the strips back across and repeat until completed.
            

              Brush the top of the pie with egg wash and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Trim the overhanging dough and crimp edges.
            

              Bake the pie until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly 50 to 60 minutes. Let rest 20 minutes before slicing.
            

Paula's Perfect Pie Crust:


              In a large mixing bowl sift together the flour salt and sugar. Add the shortening and break it up with your hands as you start to coat it all up with the flour. Add the cold butter cubes and work it into the flour with your hands or a pastry cutter. Work it quickly so the butter doesn't get too soft until the mixture is crumbly like very coarse cornmeal. Add the ice water a little at a time until the mixture comes together forming a dough. Bring the dough together into a ball.
            

              When it comes together stop working it otherwise the dough will get over-worked and tough. Divide the dough in half and flatten it slightly to form a disk shape. Wrap each disk in plastic and chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. On a floured surface roll each disk out into a 10 to 11-inch circle to make a 9-inch pie.

Salted Preserved Lemons Recipe | Jamie Oliver | Food Network, Fennel seeds Cinnamon stick Coriander seeds Peppercorns Bay Leaf Sea salt Large fat Lemons (preferably Sicilian ones with the leaves still attached) ,               In a bowl mix the spices into the sea salt. Cut a cross into the lemons -- almost to the base but so that the quarters stay together. Push the seasoned salt into the lemon segments and pack the lemons as tightly as possible into an airtight jar. The less space there is between the lemons the more attractive it will look and you won't need to use so much salt. The lemons will be ready after one month of preserving and will last for about 2 years. Tips:The peel is edible This also works very well with limes You could preserve oranges like this too -- but there are not so many recipes which use them You must use sea salt not table salt -- table salt is too chemical and harsh
            

              Uses:For seasoning rice and couscous -- it works like salt and makes the rice and couscous lemon scented Put chicken/fish into a foil bag and bake with the lemon salt Use to season stews and soups ;

Almond Paste Recipe | Food Network, 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons (250 grams) sugar 1/4 cup (75 grams) honey 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons (100 grams) water 3 cups plus 3 tablespoons (500 grams) blanched whole almonds 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon (50 grams) Kirsch or simple syrup optional Scant 1/4 cup (50 grams) butter ,               Place the sugar honey and water in a saucepan and bring to a strong boil. Place the almonds in the food processor and grind until coarse. Remove the boiling sugar from the heat and pour over the coarse almonds. Blend until smooth. This may take 10 minutes or more depending on the strength of the food processor. Remember food processors are not usually strong enough to yield the same consistency as the almond paste that you can buy. If your mixture is too thick and the food processor is straining you can add a little Kirsch or simple syrup to the processor. Add the liquid slowly and stop when the processor is moving more freely. The quality of almond paste is determined by how smooth the consistency is.
            

              Wrap the almond paste in plastic wrap and allow it to cool. When you are ready to use it knead in the butter. The butter makes it smooth and not so sticky.

Apple Pie Egg Roll Recipe | Kelsey Nixon | Food Network, 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter 3 Granny Smith apples peeled cored and cut into 1/4-inch pieces 1/2 vanilla bean split and scraped for seeds 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch of salt 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons lemon juice (about half a lemon) Eight 6-inch square egg roll wrappers 2 eggs beaten Peanut oil for frying Powdered sugar for dusting ,               For the filling: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples and vanilla bean and saute for about 2 minutes. Add the sugar cinnamon and salt to the pan and cook until the apples start to turn a light caramel-golden brown but aren't falling apart 6 to 8 minutes. The apples should still have some tooth to them. Add the flour and cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes to remove the raw taste from the flour. Fold in the lemon juice. Spread the filling out in an even layer on a baking sheet and refrigerate until cold.
            

              For the egg rolls: Arrange an egg roll wrapper in a diamond shape on a board in front of you. Brush the borders with beaten egg. Spoon 2 to 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling into the center of the wrapper. Take care to leave about 1 inch between the filling and the edges of the wrapper. Fold the end of the wrapper nearest you over the filling then fold the sides over. Finally roll the wrapper into a tight cylinder tucking and tightening as you go.
            

              Repeat with the remaining wrappers until all the filling is used. As you go remember to keep the unused wrappers as well as the finished egg rolls covered with a towel to prevent them from drying out.
            

              Add 4 to 5 inches of oil to a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven and heat to 350 degrees F.
            

              Fry the egg rolls in batches of 4 until golden brown 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet.

One at a time carefully dredge the cooked eggs in flour then roll in the beaten eggs letting the excess drip off and roll in the breadcrumbs. Roll in the beaten eggs again and reroll in the breadcrumbs. Put the eggs on a parchment-lined plate; refrigerate while you make the gravy. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the seasoned flour.
            

              Make the gravy: Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Crumble the sausage into the skillet and cook breaking it up with a wooden spoon until browned 3 to 4 minutes. Add the thyme and the reserved 2 tablespoons seasoned flour and cook stirring 1 minute. Stir in the chicken broth and cream and bring to a simmer. Cook stirring occasionally until the gravy thickens 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper. Add more cream or water if the gravy is too thick. Keep warm.
            

              Deep-fry the eggs: Heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 375 degrees F. Using a slotted spoon carefully lower the breaded eggs into the hot oil and fry turning until golden brown about 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
            

              Serve the gravy and fried eggs on the biscuits.

Creamy Arugula and Lettuce Soup with Goat Cheese Recipe | Giada De Laurentiis | Food Network, 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 shallot thinly sliced 3/4 pound Yukon gold potatoes peeled and diced 4 cups chicken or vegetable stock 1 cup chopped about 2 ounces assorted lettuce (butter red leaf green leaf) 2 cups (2 ounces) arugula or spinach leaves 1/4 cup cream 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ,               Garnish: 2 1/2 ounces goat cheese sliced
            

              In a medium pot warm the olive oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until tender and starting to brown about 4 minutes. Add the potatoes and the stock. Bring the stock to a simmer over high heat. Reduce the heat and continue to simmer covered until the potatoes are almost tender about 20 minutes. Add the arugula and lettuce to the pot and continue simmering uncovered until the greens are tender another 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon transfer the potatoes and greens to a blender. Pour in enough of the stock to cover the vegetables. Add the cream salt and pepper.
            

              *Blend the ingredients together until smooth. Be careful to blend slowly at first with a kitchen towel held tight to the top of the blender lid. Blending hot ingredients can cause the lid to blow off. Pour the blended soup back into the pot with the remaining stock. Stir to combine. Cover and keep warm.
            

              Pour the soup into 4 serving bowls. Top each soup with 1/2-ounce sliced goat cheese. Serve immediately.
            

              * When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.

Strawberry Tart Recipe | Anne Burrell | Food Network, 1 1/2 sticks cold butter cut into pea-size pieces 1 cup all-purpose flour plus extra for dusting 3/4 cup sliced almonds toasted Pinch kosher salt 1 egg yolk 3 to 4 tablespoons ice water 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup sugar 1 vanilla bean scraped 4 eggs 1/3 cup cornstarch 1/2 cup milk 1 quart fresh strawberries topped and sliced Powdered sugar for garnish , Watch how to make this recipe.


              Special Equipment: 1 pound dried beans 10-inch tart pan
            

              For the crust:
            

              In the food processor combine the butter flour almonds and salt and pulse pulse pulse until it looks like grated cheese as I like to call the Parmigiano stage. Add the egg yolk and half the water and pulse; the dough should start to come together. If it does not add the remaining water and pulse until the dough forms into a ball. Dump the "doughball" onto a floured work surface and using the heel of your hand "schmear" it across the work surface. Repeat this process 1 to 2 more times then form the dough into a disk wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 to 45 minutes.
            

              *TIP- this can be done up to a week in advance or frozen for a longer time.
            

              Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
            

              To roll the crust:
            

              Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 10 minutes before rolling to let it soften. On a lightly floured work surface roll the dough to 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Lay the dough in the tart pan. Make a small "doughball" with a little of the dough that is hanging over the edge of the tart pan. Dip the dough ball in flour and use is to carefully push the dough into the corners of the tart pan. Once the dough has been pushed into the corners of the tart pan use the rolling pin to roll over the top edge of the tart pan to cut a clean crisp edge. Line the tart with aluminum foil be sure to push it into the corners. This will keep the sides of the tart tall and straight and able to hold the filling. Fill the tart with the dried beans. Place in the preheated oven for 12 to 14 minutes. Remove the beans and foil and bake for another 4 to 5 minutes. The dough should be cooked through and lightly browned. Remove from the oven and cool.
            

              For the pastry cream:
            

              Place the heavy cream 1/2 cup of the sugar and the vanilla bean seeds and pod in a saucepan. Whisk to combine and bring to a boil over low heat. While the cream is coming to a boil combine the eggs and remaining 1/2 cup of sugar in a bowl and the cornstarch and milk in another bowl. Beat with a whisk to a homogeneous mixture no big lumps of egg white! When the cream comes to a boil remove it from the heat and discard the vanilla bean pod. *Whisk half of the cream into the egg/sugar mixture and then IMMEDIATELY whisk it back into the pan with the hot cream.
            

              *This is called tempering and will allow you to combine boiling cream and eggs without making scrambled eggs.
            

              Return the pan to a medium heat and gradually whisk in the cornstarch/milk mixture. Bring this to a boil to thicken the pastry cream. Stir frequently to prevent scorching. It is necessary to bring this mixture to a boil to cook the starch. If the mixture is not brought to a boil the mixture will feel starchy and gritty. The desired outcome is the consistency of vanilla pudding. YUM! Transfer the mixture to a bowl and chill. This can be done really quickly over an ice bath.
            

              To assemble the tart:
            

              Fill the tart shell with the chilled pastry cream. Top with the sliced strawberries. You can arrange the strawberries in circles or in lines; it's up to you! Just make it look pretty. Sprinkle with powdered sugar just before serving.
            

              Berry delicious!

Sunflower Cake Recipe | Food Network, 2 round 9-inch cakes cooled 1 recipe vanilla buttercream colored yellow 1 recipe best chocolate frosting ,               Using a palette knife frost 1 of the 9-inch cakes with the chocolate frosting. Frost the sides first building extra frosting at the top of the sides. Then frost the top. Since this part of the cake is supposed to look like the center of a sunflower the frosting should not be smooth but should swirl into peaks. To create this swirled peaked effect lightly run the palette knife through the frosting and gently pull up. Using a spatula place the cake in the center of a platter that is at least 20-inches by 20-inches or you can use a piece of cardboard that is covered with foil.
            

              To create the petals: Using a serrated knife cut the second 9-inch cake in half. Then cut each of the halves in half again. You should have 4 triangles. Cut each of these 4 triangles in half again to create 8 triangular pieces. Using a paring knife trim each of the eight petals to curve slightly inward so they hug the outside of the center of the cake. Be careful not to trim off too much. Start at the corner of the curved edge and trim a slightly rounded arc that ends at the opposite corner of the rounded edge. Using the yellow frosting and a small spatula or palette knife frost the top and 2 sides. There is no need to frost the curved edge. Once the pieces are frosted place them around the cake. Looking at the cake as though it was a clock place the petals at 12 3 6 and 9. Place the remaining four petals in between 12 and 3 in between 3 and 6 in between 6 and 9 and in between 9 and 12.

              Preheat oven to 250 degrees F preheat grill to low heat (less than 250 degrees F) and preheat fryer to 350 degrees F.
            

              In a small bowl combine oil apple cider vinegar garlic powder onion powder paprika salt and pepper until a thick paste has formed. Rub this paste onto the pork.
            

              Using mesquite wood chips smoke the pork for 45 minutes at a low temperature less than 250 degrees F. To set up a smoker turn on grill and once the coals are covered in white ash place in wood chips that have been soaking in water for 30 minutes. Do not spread the fire out as you would normally do when grilling. Leave the coals piled up on 1 side and put meat on the other side of fire on top of grate.
            

              Remove the pork and wrap it several times very tightly with plastic wrap then wrap several times with aluminum foil making sure that there is no plastic wrap showing. Place the wrapped pork in the oven and cook for 5 hours.
            

              Remove from the oven and let rest for 45 minutes. Unwrap the pork and pull it apart with your hands being careful as the meat will be hot. Place the shredded meat into a stainless steel bowl. Add BBQ sauce stir and set aside.
            

              In a medium saucepan combine the rice and water and cook over low heat until all of the water is absorbed but the rice is still a little moist. Place rice into a stainless steel bowl and allow to cool for 15 minutes. Once cooled with a rubber spatula fold in the sugar and rice wine vinegar. Allow to sit for 10 more minutes.
            

              Place a Bamboo sushi mat flat onto a cutting board. Place 1 piece of seaweed paper on top of the mat. Wet your hands with water so the rice will not stick. Using 1/4 of the rice spread an even layer of rice covering the bottom half of the sushi paper entirely. On top of the rice place 2 ounces of the pulled pork in a horizontal line shaping the line into a tube-like cylindrical shape. Cut 1 scallion to the same width of the sushi paper and place it next to the pork.
            

              To roll the sushi take the bottom of the mat (side closest to you) and gently lift it and start to fold it towards the top of the mat (side furthest away from your body). The mat should serve as a guide to roll the sushi into a cigar-like shape. As you fold the mat the paper will fold over and start to form a tube about 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Make sure that you apply enough pressure so that this tube keeps its shape as you continue to move the bottom of the mat towards the top of the mat. The end result should be a nice cylindrical roll with the seaweed paper around the outside and the rice pork and scallion in the center. Repeat 3 more times and set aside.
            

              In a large mixing bowl whisk together the egg yolk and flour. Add soda water until a pancake consistency batter forms. Add 2 or 3 ice cubes and whisk again. Roll the entire sushi roll in the cornstarch and then dip it into the batter coating evenly. Place the roll in 350 degrees F oil and fry for 2 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oil drain and cut into evenly-sized pieces.
            

              Arrange neatly on a plate and garnish with pickled ginger and pickled okra. Drizzle with Chipotle Aioli and enjoy!

Pan-Roasted Veal Stuffed with Spinach Recipe | Food Network, 10 ounces fresh spinach Salt 2 pounds boned veal breast (if you purchase the breast bone-in it should weigh about 4 pounds) 4 large garlic cloves peeled 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon vegetable oil Freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup dry white wine 1 cup coarsely chopped peeled fresh ripe tomatoes or 1 cup coarsely chopped canned whole peeled tomatoes with their juice ,               Remove any large thick stems from the spinach and rinse the leaves in cold water. Put the spinach in a pot with just the water that clings to the leaves and sprinkle with salt. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until all the spinach is wilted. Drain in a colander and press with a large spoon to remove as much water as possible.
            

              Lay the veal flat and trim the excess fat (do not remove all of it or the roast will be too dry when done). Spread the spinach over the veal and add the garlic cloves evenly spaced apart. Roll up the veal jelly-roll fashion and tie it securely with kitchen twine.
            

              Put the butter and vegetable oil in a heavy braising pan that will hold the veal comfortably and place it over high heat. When the oil and butter are hot put in the veal and brown it well on all sides. Season with salt and pepper then add the wine. Allow the wine to bubble for 1 to 2 minutes to evaporate the alcohol and use a wooden spoon to loosen the tasty bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add the tomatoes. When they begin to bubble lower the heat so that the contents of the pan cook at a gentle but steady simmer. Cover the pan with the lid slightly askew and cook until the meat is tender when pierced with a fork about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Turn the meat from time to time and add a little water to the pan if all the liquid evaporates before the veal is done.
            

              When ready to serve cut the veal in slices about 1/2 inch thick and remove the twine. If the sauce in the pan needs to be reduced raise the heat and cook until it is thick enough to coat a spoon. Arrange the veal slices on a platter and pour the hot sauce over them. Serve at once.

Pizza Dough Recipe | Jamie Oliver | Food Network, 7 cups strong white bread flour or Tipo "00" flour or 5 cups strong white bread flour or Tipo "00" flour plus 2 cups finely ground semolina flour 1 level tablespoon fine sea salt 2 (1/4-ounce) packets active dried yeast 1 tablespoon raw sugar 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 1/2 cups lukewarm water ,               This is a fantastic reliable everyday pizza dough which can also be used to make bread. It's best made with Italian Tipo "00" flour which is finer ground than normal flour and it will give your dough an incredible super-smooth texture. Look for it in Italian markets and good supermarkets. If using white bread flour instead make sure it's a strong one that's high in gluten as this will transform into a lovely elastic dough which is what you want. Mix in some semolina flour for a bit of color and flavor if you like.
            

              Sift the flours and salt onto a clean work surface and make a well in the middle. In a large measuring cup mix the yeast sugar and olive oil into the water and leave for a few minutes then pour into the well. Using a fork bring the flour in gradually from the sides and swirl it into the liquid. Keep mixing drawing larger amounts of flour in and when it all starts to come together work the rest of the flour in with your clean flour-dusted hands. Knead until you have a smooth springy dough.
            

              Place the ball of dough in a large flour-dusted bowl and flour the top of it. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and place in a warm room for about 1 hour until the dough has doubled in size.
            

              Now remove the dough to a flour-dusted surface and knead it around a bit to push the air out with your hands - this is called punching down the dough. You can either use it immediately or keep it wrapped in plastic wrap in the fridge (or freezer) until required. If using straightaway divide the dough up into as many little balls as you want to make pizzas - this amount of dough is enough to make about six to eight medium pizzas.
            

              Timing-wise it's a good idea to roll the pizzas out about 15 to 20 minutes before you want to cook them. Don't roll them out and leave them hanging around for a few hours though - if you are working in advance like this it's better to leave your dough covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator. However if you want to get them rolled out so there's 1 less thing to do when your guests are round simply roll the dough out into rough circles about 1/4-inch thick and place them on slightly larger pieces of olive-oil-rubbed and flour-dusted aluminum foil. You can then stack the pizzas cover them with plastic wrap and pop them into the refrigerator.

              Toss the potatoes in a bowl with the oil salt and pepper until completely coated. Place on a baking sheet and bake until fork tender about 45 minutes.
            

              Meanwhile bring a small pot of water to a boil and salt it generously. Fill a medium bowl with ice water. Put the chives in the boiling water and cook until bright green about 30 seconds. Immediately plunge into the ice water to set the color. Squeeze all the water out of the chives and give them a rough chop. Put into a blender with the sour cream. Pulse until you have a smooth green sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste. Chill until ready to serve. (Or thinly slice the chives and stir into the sour cream season with salt and pepper to taste.)
            

              Cut the potatoes lengthwise and then across. Pinch and press the sides to open the potatoes. Divide the butter among the potatoes and serve with the sour cream. Garnish with crumbled bacon if desired.
