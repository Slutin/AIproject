              Roast the poblano chiles one-by-one over the flame of your stovetop using metal tongs to hold them until the skin is totally charred. (If you don't have a gas stove you can use an outdoor grill OR place them on a baking sheet directly under your oven's broiler.) When the skin is totally blackened place the chiles in a large resealable plastic bag and seal the bag to allow the chiles to sweat for a good 20 minutes. Remove the chiles and use a knife to scrape off most of the blackened skin. Slice the chiles in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds and membranes.

Put Muu Waan Sweet Pork on top of the rice in a strip and garnish with shallots and cilantro. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
            

Muun Waan:


              Clean the excess fat and gristle from the pork butt and cut it into 1-inch thick pieces. Cut along the grain of meat so that long strands will form when the meat is shredded. Marinate the pork pieces in sweet soy. Put the pork in a rondeau or another round straight-walled pan. Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil over medium heat. Lower the heat cover the pot and cook slowly until pork is almost tender. Turn the heat to high and reduce the liquid until relatively dry leaving more of a glaze than a liquid. Roughly shred the pork with a stiff whisk and spatula. Do not wait until pork is already falling apart to reduce the liquid. This will produce a dry and tough product. If the pork is accidentally cooked all the way before reducing the liquid remove the meat from liquid and reduce separately then return the meat to the pot.
            

OR:


              Adjust water amount according to the newness of the rice (if the rice is newer then less water will be required). In a rice cooker combine the water coconut milk or coconut cream sugar and salt and mix until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Add the drained rice and mix thoroughly making sure the rice is level in the cooker. Cook the rice according to the cooker instructions.
            

              Fresh Coconut Milk: Thaw grated coconut. Remove the coconut from the bags and add to a large bowl. Add 3 cups water per 16-ounce bag of grated coconut. Allow to sit until the water is absorbed about 1/2 hour. Press the coconut twice through a fine strainer using the milk from the first pressing to moisten the coconut again then strain for the last time.
            

Papaya Pok Pok:


              Smash the chiles garlic and palm sugar in a mortar and pestle until the garlic is well ground; do this firmly but not violently. Add the shrimp mash lightly and then add the long beans. Smash them gently just to break them up. Add the dressing and the papaya. Combine the ingredients thoroughly without mashing the papaya. Add the tomatoes and crush to release their juices. Stir in the peanuts and combine well. The taste should be sour salty sweet and spicy in good balance. The texture should be crunchy and slightly pink in color.

Fried Chicken Recipe | Ree Drummond | Food Network, 2 fryer chickens each cut into 8 pieces 4 1/4 cups buttermilk 5 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons seasoned salt such as Lawry's 2 teaspoons paprika 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoons ground dried thyme 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper plus more for seasoning 1/4 cup milk Canola or vegetable oil for frying , Watch how to make this recipe.

Special equipment: a deep-fry thermometer

              Thoroughly rinse the chicken pieces then place them in a bowl and cover with 4 cups of the buttermilk. Soak in the fridge overnight or up to 24 hours.
            

              When you're ready to fry the chicken remove the bowl from the fridge and let it sit on the counter for 30 minutes just to take the chill off.
            

              In the meantime preheat the oven to 360 degrees F and mix up the breading. Place the flour seasoned salt paprika black pepper thyme and cayenne (plus extra cayenne if you like heat) in a very large bowl. Stir together well.
            

              In a small bowl combine the remaining 1/4 cup buttermilk and the milk. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and gradually mix with a fork until there are little lumps throughout; these will adhere to the chicken and make for a crispier breading. If necessary add a little more flour or milk to make the breading slightly lumpy.
            

              Heat 1 1/2 to 2 inches of oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer reaches 365 degrees F. Lower the heat slightly if necessary to keep the oil from getting hotter.
            

              Working in batches thoroughly coat each chicken piece with breading pressing extra breading onto the chicken if necessary. Place the breaded pieces on a plate.
            

              Add the breaded chicken to the oil 3 or 4 pieces at a time; make sure they don't stick together. Cover the pan and fry for 5 to 7 minutes checking occasionally to make sure the chicken isn't getting too brown. Turn the pieces over cover again and cook for 3 to 5 minutes more. All the while monitor the temperature of the oil to make sure the chicken doesn't burn.
            

              Transfer the fried chicken to a baking sheet and continue frying the rest of the chicken. When all the chicken has been fried remove the wings and legs to a plate and keep covered. (These should be cooked all the way through by now but always check if any pink juice or meat is visible. If so return to the hot oil for another minute or so until fully cooked.) Leave the thighs and breasts on the baking sheet.
            

              Bake the thighs and breasts for 15 minutes to finish cooking. (Sometimes I'll cut into the thicker part of one of the larger pieces just to make sure the chicken is cooked through. If any pink juice or meat is visible the chicken needs to continue cooking in the oven.)

Sausage and Smoked Slaw Pizzette Recipe | Food Network, Flour for dusting 1 pound pizza dough 1/2 cup Red Onion Marmalade recipe follows 8 ounces House Sausage recipe follows 1/2 cup Smoked Slaw recipe follows Salt and pepper 3 large red onions Salt 1/2 cup dark balsamic vinegar divided 1/4 cup sugar Splash water 1/4 cup chopped garlic 1/4 cup grated onion 4 sprigs fresh oregano leaves chopped 1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley 1/2 teaspoon fennel seed toasted and ground 1 teaspoon ground dried oregano 1 to 2 tablespoons crushed red chile flakes (depends on desired heat level) 1/3 cup red wine 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon sugar 2 tablespoons salt 1 teaspoon ground pepper 1 1/2 pounds pork shoulder ground 1/2 head savoy cabbage 2 tablespoons whole grain mustard 1/4 cup aioli* 1 shallot grated 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1/2 teaspoon sugar Salt and pepper , Special equipment: Handful hickory wood chips

              Preheat your oven to 500 degrees F. Dust a work station with flour and cut the dough in half. When the dough is at room temperature stretch it or roll it out using a rolling pin; you want a thin pizza dough approximately 1/4-thick at the most. (A pizzette is a rustic oval shape though it will work in the more traditional circle.) Place the dough onto a sheet of parchment paper on a sheet tray and bake in the oven until the dough has set and started to brown about 3 minutes. Remove from the oven and spread a thin layer of Red Onion Marmalade. Crumble the House Sausage over the pizza and spread out evenly. Place back into the oven and bake until the dough has hardened and you can lift one side of the pizza without it bending about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and drape with Smoked Slaw. Cut and enjoy.
            

Red Onion Marmalade:


              Cut the top and bottom off the onion and peel the skin. Cut vertically straight down through the middle exposing a crescent moon shape not rings. Place the onion cut side down on the board and slice into julienne. Repeat with all the onions.
            

              Place the onions into a saucepan and put over a low heat on your stovetop. Sprinkle with a little salt and stir. Cook stirring occasionally allowing the onions to sweat out their liquid until they all become translucent (being careful not to caramelize or burn the onions) about 20 minutes. Add in half the balsamic and reduce over low heat until the liquid coats the back of a spoon 15 to 20 minutes. Reserve.
            

              In a separate pan over high heat pour the sugar into the center of the pan and surround with water. Stir the sugar into the water to moisten. Occasionally shake the pan to evenly disperse the heat. Keep a close eye on the sugar-water mixture as the moisture is expelled. First the bubbles will be smaller and more consistent like syrup. Then the sugar will start to change color as it caramelizes. When it is a light amber color remove from the heat and stir in the remaining balsamic vinegar until incorporated. Add the caramel sauce to the cooked onions and season with salt. Cool and serve.
            

House Sausage:


              Add all the ingredients except the pork into a large bowl. Whisk together and let rest for 10 minutes. Add in the ground pork. Break the pork apart gently and toss to distribute ingredients. Mix by kneading the mixture but do not over mix. Cook a small piece of sausage to test for seasoning. If needed add salt and a splash more vinegar. For pizza preparation render the sausage until lightly browned and strain excess fat. Cool and reserve for assembly.
            

Smoked Slaw:


              Remove the core from the cabbage and julienne. To assemble the smoker place the wood chips into a half hotel pan over high heat. After 2 minutes the chips will start to smolder. Place some ice into a perforated pan of the same size and cover with a layer of plastic wrap. Place the perforated pan with the ice and the cabbage onto the pan with the chips and cover with tin foil. Allow the smoke to permeate the cabbage for 4 minutes. Remove from the pan and place directly into a bowl. Add the remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper. Cool and reserve.

Sausage and Smoked Slaw Pizzette Recipe | Food Network, Flour for dusting 1 pound pizza dough 1/2 cup Red Onion Marmalade recipe follows 8 ounces House Sausage recipe follows 1/2 cup Smoked Slaw recipe follows Salt and pepper 3 large red onions Salt 1/2 cup dark balsamic vinegar divided 1/4 cup sugar Splash water 1/4 cup chopped garlic 1/4 cup grated onion 4 sprigs fresh oregano leaves chopped 1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley 1/2 teaspoon fennel seed toasted and ground 1 teaspoon ground dried oregano 1 to 2 tablespoons crushed red chile flakes (depends on desired heat level) 1/3 cup red wine 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon sugar 2 tablespoons salt 1 teaspoon ground pepper 1 1/2 pounds pork shoulder ground 1/2 head savoy cabbage 2 tablespoons whole grain mustard 1/4 cup aioli* 1 shallot grated 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1/2 teaspoon sugar Salt and pepper , Special equipment: Handful hickory wood chips

              Preheat your oven to 500 degrees F. Dust a work station with flour and cut the dough in half. When the dough is at room temperature stretch it or roll it out using a rolling pin; you want a thin pizza dough approximately 1/4-thick at the most. (A pizzette is a rustic oval shape though it will work in the more traditional circle.) Place the dough onto a sheet of parchment paper on a sheet tray and bake in the oven until the dough has set and started to brown about 3 minutes. Remove from the oven and spread a thin layer of Red Onion Marmalade. Crumble the House Sausage over the pizza and spread out evenly. Place back into the oven and bake until the dough has hardened and you can lift one side of the pizza without it bending about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and drape with Smoked Slaw. Cut and enjoy.
            

Red Onion Marmalade:


              Cut the top and bottom off the onion and peel the skin. Cut vertically straight down through the middle exposing a crescent moon shape not rings. Place the onion cut side down on the board and slice into julienne. Repeat with all the onions.
            

              Place the onions into a saucepan and put over a low heat on your stovetop. Sprinkle with a little salt and stir. Cook stirring occasionally allowing the onions to sweat out their liquid until they all become translucent (being careful not to caramelize or burn the onions) about 20 minutes. Add in half the balsamic and reduce over low heat until the liquid coats the back of a spoon 15 to 20 minutes. Reserve.
            

              In a separate pan over high heat pour the sugar into the center of the pan and surround with water. Stir the sugar into the water to moisten. Occasionally shake the pan to evenly disperse the heat. Keep a close eye on the sugar-water mixture as the moisture is expelled. First the bubbles will be smaller and more consistent like syrup. Then the sugar will start to change color as it caramelizes. When it is a light amber color remove from the heat and stir in the remaining balsamic vinegar until incorporated. Add the caramel sauce to the cooked onions and season with salt. Cool and serve.
            

House Sausage:


              Add all the ingredients except the pork into a large bowl. Whisk together and let rest for 10 minutes. Add in the ground pork. Break the pork apart gently and toss to distribute ingredients. Mix by kneading the mixture but do not over mix. Cook a small piece of sausage to test for seasoning. If needed add salt and a splash more vinegar. For pizza preparation render the sausage until lightly browned and strain excess fat. Cool and reserve for assembly.
            

Smoked Slaw:


              Remove the core from the cabbage and julienne. To assemble the smoker place the wood chips into a half hotel pan over high heat. After 2 minutes the chips will start to smolder. Place some ice into a perforated pan of the same size and cover with a layer of plastic wrap. Place the perforated pan with the ice and the cabbage onto the pan with the chips and cover with tin foil. Allow the smoke to permeate the cabbage for 4 minutes. Remove from the pan and place directly into a bowl. Add the remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper. Cool and reserve.

Smoke for 2 hours at 200 degrees F and then raise the temperature to 250 degrees F for about 2 1/2 hours. Check for tenderness by testing if the bones will pull apart with a slight bit of pressure. If they are still tough allow to cook for another 30 minutes.
            

              Remove from the smoker. For dry-style ribs sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon rub. For wet-style ribs glaze with the BBQ sauce.

Transfer to the rack as done.
            

              Wipe up any oil drips from the baking sheet so they don't smoke up your kitchen. Transfer the chicken on the rack and baking sheet to the oven and bake until cooked through and the center registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer 10 to 20 minutes.

              For the roasted garlic and tomato hollandaise: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
            

              Toss the tomatoes and garlic with the oil in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. Put on a baking sheet and roast until the tomatoes and garlic are soft and the liquid has evaporated about 30 minutes. Let cool slightly.
            

              Combine the egg yolks and lemon juice in a blender and blend until smooth. With the motor running slowly add the melted butter and continue blending until emulsified. Add the tomato-garlic mixture and blend until smooth. Cover and keep warm.
            

              For the sandwiches: Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat until it begins to shimmer about 2 minutes.

Remove to a work surface keeping the bacon sides up. Quickly add the remaining butter to the skillet and add the muffin tops cut-side down to toast.
            

              Spoon about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the warm hollandaise on top of each egg then top with a toasted muffin top. Serve immediately.

Simmer for 10 minutes in 2 quarts of water. Rinse in cold water. Dry.
            

              In a heavy large heavy bottomed casserole or Dutch oven saute the bacon slowly in hot butter until it is very lightly browned (temperature of 260 degrees F for an electric skillet). Remove to a side dish.
            

              Dry the chicken thoroughly. Brown it in the hot fat in the casserole. (360 degrees F for the electric skillet.)
            

              Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Return the bacon to the casserole with the chicken. Cover and cook slowly (300 degrees F) for 10 minutes turning the chicken once.
            

              Uncover and pour in the cognac. Averting your face ignite the cognac with a lighted match. Shake the casserole back and forth for several seconds until the flames subside.
            

              Pour the wine into the casserole. Add just enough stock or bouillon to cover the chicken. Stir in the tomato paste garlic and herbs. Bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer slowly for 20 to 25 minutes or until the chicken is tender and its juices run a clear yellow when the meat is pricked with a fork. Remove the chicken to a side dish.
            

              While the chicken is cooking prepare the onions and mushrooms.
            

              Simmer the chicken cooking liquid in the casserole for 1 to 2 minutes skimming off fat. Then raise the heat and boil rapidly reducing the liquid to about 2 1/4 cups. Correct seasoning. Remove from heat and discard bay leaf.
            

              Blend the butter and flour together into a smooth paste (beurre manie). Beat the paste into the hot liquid with a wire whip. Bring to the simmer stirring and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon lightly.
            

              Arrange the chicken in a casserole place the mushrooms and onions around it and baste with the sauce. If the dish is not to be served immediately film the top of the sauce with stock or dot with small pieces of butter. Set aside uncovered for no longer than 1 hour or cool cover and refrigerate until needed.
            

              Shortly before serving bring the casserole to a simmer basting the chicken with the sauce. Cover and simmer slowly for 4 to 5 minutes until the chicken is heated through.

Brown-Braised Onions:


              When the butter and oil are bubbling in the skillet add the onions and saute over moderate heat for 10 minutes rolling the onions about so they will brown as evenly as possible. Be careful not to break their skins. You cannot expect to brown them uniformly.
            

              Braise them as follows: Pour in the stock season to taste and add the herb bouquet. Cover and simmer slowly for 15 to 20 minutes until the onions are perfectly tender but retain their shape and the liquid has evaporated. Remove herb bouquet. Serve them as they are.
            

              Bake them as follows: Transfer the onions and their sauteing fat to a shallow baking dish or casserole just large enough to hold them in 1 layer. Set uncovered in upper third of a preheated 350 degree F oven for 40 to 50 minutes turning them over once or twice. They should be very tender retain their shape and be a nice golden brown. Remove herb bouquet. Serve them as they are.
            

Sauteed Mushrooms:


              Place the skillet over high heat with the butter and oil. As soon as you see that the butter foam has begun to subside indicating it is hot enough add the mushrooms. Toss and shake the pan for 4 to 5 minutes. During their saute the mushrooms will at first absorb the fat. In 2 to 3 minutes the fat will reappear on their surface and the mushrooms will begin to brown. As soon as they have browned lightly remove from heat.
            

              Toss the shallots or green onions if using with the mushrooms. Saute over moderate heat for 2 minutes. Sauteed mushrooms may be cooked in advance set aside then reheated when needed. Season to taste just before serving.

Mini Cherry Pies Recipe | Anne Thornton | Food Network, 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour plus more for bench and cutters 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 2 sticks chilled unsalted butter cut into 1/2-inch cubes 4 tablespoons ice water plus more as needed 4 cups fresh pitted cherries 1 cup sugar 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1 tablespoon fresh lemon zest Cooking spray Special equipment: 1 1/2-inch and 2-inch round cookie or biscuit cutters , Watch how to make this recipe.


              For the crust: In a food processor combine the flour sugar salt and butter. Pulse the processor until the mixture resembles fine sand. Remove the lid and add the ice water to the mixture. Run the processor just until the mixture rolls itself into a little ball. If the mixture is a bit dry add more ice water by the tablespoonful until it comes together. Gather the dough into a ball. With a bench scraper or knife divide the mixture evenly in half. Shape each half into a disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and chill at least 30 minutes.
            

              Cook's Note: At this point you can keep the wrapped dough in the refrigerator for a few days or freeze for later use.
            

              For the filling: In a saucepan combine the pitted cherries and 1 cup water over medium-low heat for 10 minutes. In a small bowl combine the sugar and cornstarch. Using a whisk swirl the ingredients together making sure that there aren't any lumps in the cornstarch. Add the sugar-cornstarch mixture and lemon zest to the cherries. Cook the cherry mixture until it comes to a rolling boil. Cook 1 minute more until thickened. Allow the cherry filling to cool slightly while you prepare the crust.
            

              Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spray a 24 cup mini muffin tin or 2 (12 cup) mini muffin tins with cooking spray.
            

              Roll the dough disks out into 10-inch rounds on a well-floured work surface. With a 1 1/2-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter edge lightly dipped in flour cut 24 rounds from the first rolled out disk. With a 2-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter edge lightly dipped in flour cut 24 rounds from the second rolled out disk. You should have a total of 24 (1 1/2-inch) rounds and 24 (2-inch) rounds for matching top and bottom crusts.
            

              Gently fit the 2-inch dough rounds into the bottom of the prepared mini muffin tin. Make sure to pat down the bottom and the excess coming up the sides. Spoon about 1 heaping tablespoon cooled pie filling into each crust-lined cup. Fit the top of each mini pie with a 1 1/2-inch dough round pushing down gently and sealing the bottom crust and top crust by crimping the edges together with a fork. With a sharp paring knife make 3 small incisions on the top crust to allow the steam to escape.
            

              Bake until the edges are golden brown and the filling is bubbly about 12 minutes. Allow to cool on a wire rack and then remove from the muffin tin.

Stirato Recipe | Food Network, Bowl or container Spatula Plastic dough scraper Rectangular baking stone Rimmed baking sheet for the oven Dowel or wooden spoon with a long handle or a chopstick Parchment paper cut to the size of the baking stone Cutting board or second baking sheet to move the loaves to the oven Cooling rack 500 grams unbleached all-purpose flour 375 grams water 80 degrees F (27 degrees C) 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast 1 tablespoon sourdough (optional) 10 grams sea salt Semolina flour for dusting the loaves ,               Morning: Combine the flour water yeast and sourdough if using in a bowl mixing together with a spatula or your hand moistened with water for about 1 minute. After the ingredients are combined make a small indentation on the top of the dough. Add the salt to the small well you've just made in the dough and about 1 tablespoon of water to cover it but don't mix it in yet. Cover the bowl and let the dough sit for 20 minutes. Moisten your hands slightly and use the dough scraper to loosen the dough from the bowl. Rather than knead the dough you're going to stretch and fold it in the bowl. Working from the edges of the dough pull the dough out to stretch it and then fold it over toward the center. You can also squeeze the dough with your fingers to help incorporate the salt. If your hands begin to stick to the dough moisten them again with water. Work around the dough and stretch and fold it 12 times. This action should take about 1 minute in total. Flip the dough over so the folds are underneath and the smooth side is on top. Cover the bowl and let the dough sit for another 20 minutes. Do the stretch-and-fold action for one more round. By now you'll notice that the salt is incorporated and the gluten offers noticeable tension. After folding about 12 times turn the dough over again cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 20 minutes. Do the stretch-and-fold action 2 more times at 20-minute intervals. In the final round the dough should feel very elastic and should be glistening. If it isn't add a few more stretch-and-fold actions but be careful not to rip the dough. Turn the dough over so the smooth side is face up. Cover the bowl and let it sit for 6 to 7 hours. The goal here is for the dough to rise until it has at least tripled in size but has not collapsed in on itself. By the end of the rise you might see big air bubbles on the top of the dough.
            

              Afternoon: Preheat the oven to 470 degrees F (245 degrees C) with your baking stone on the middle rack 60 minutes before baking. In the lower part of the oven or on the bottom place a rimmed baking sheet that can hold half a cup of water. Place a piece of parchment paper roughly the size of your baking stone on an overturned and lightly floured baking sheet or a cutting board. Dust the parchment lightly with a 50/50 mixture of white flour and semolina flour or just white flour and set it aside. Flour a two-foot-square area of your counter generously with the flour/semolina mix or white flour. Dust the top of the dough lightly with flour. Using a plastic dough scraper gently loosen the dough from the bowl and pour it out onto the counter being careful to keep it in one piece. The outer smooth surface will have landed on the floured surface becoming the bottom of the dough. The top of the dough will be sticky. Dust it lightly with flour. Flour your hands and gently make a rectangle that's about 3/4 to 1 inch thick and about 10 by 16-inches with the long side on the east-west axis or parallel to the edge of the counter. Don't fuss over it to make it perfect or you'll compress the dough losing the open structure of the air holes. Sprinkle a thick line of flour across the middle of the dough moving east-west marking where you will divide the rectangle in half lengthwise. Then sprinkle another two lines of flour through each of those portions again moving east-west. You will cut the dough along the three lines making four long loaves. Using a dowel the wooden handle of a kitchen spoon or a chopstick press on the floured line so the pieces separate. A thick dull tool works well because it joins the dough together at the seam. If the tool does not fully cut through the dough use your dough scraper to finish cutting the pieces. Separate the pieces so they are not touching each other and cover them with a light towel. This second fermentation will take about 20 minutes. When the loaves are ready they will be very light and spring back within one second when you press your finger very lightly into the dough.
            

              Baking: Pour 1/2 cup water into a measuring cup. Sprinkle the loaves lightly with semolina/flour. Loosen two loaves gently with the dough scraper. If you put enough flour on the counter it won't take much effort. Place your hands under the dough at either end of one loaf then turn it upside down onto the floured parchment paper. To prevent the dough from sagging in the middle while you move the loaf you can move your two hands closer together slightly crimping the loaf lengthwise. The floured underside is now facing up. Do this with the second loaf too. (If your baking stone is big enough you might be able to place all four loaves on the parchment paper and bake them at once.) Now here's the fun part. Lightly grab either end of the dough and gently stretch out the loaf to just under the size of your baking stone. If it resists don't pull it-the dough will rip. Do the same with the second loaf. You can straighten out the edges by gently repositioning the loaf with your dough scraper but don't fuss too much. Open the oven and slide the parchment paper off the cutting board or baking sheet and onto the baking stone. The loaves will bake on the parchment paper the entire time. Close the oven. Take the 1/2 cup water and pour it onto the baking sheet being careful not to get burned by the steam. Shut the oven door. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes. Do not open the oven until at least 18 minutes into the bake. Bake until dark brown. Using a peel or oven mitts remove the loaves to a cooling rack and let them stand for at least 20 minutes before eating. Repeat the baking method with the second two loaves. These loaves are best eaten within four hours. If you do not eat all the bread the loaves can be frozen in a plastic bag. When you're ready to eat a loaf remove it from the freezer until it defrosts and bake it for 5 minutes in a 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) oven to crisp up the crust. Once reheated it will go stale relatively quickly.

Lasagne Dough:


              Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and the olive oil. Using a fork beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.
            

              As you expand the well keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape. The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.
            

              Start kneading the dough with both hands using the palms of your hands. Once you have a cohesive mass remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits. Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes. The dough should be elastic and a little sticky. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Roll or shape as desired.

Dissolve the instant coffee in a bowl with 1/3 cup warm water. Cook the sugar in a medium skillet over medium-high heat stirring occasionally until it begins to melt. Continue cooking swirling the pan but not stirring until the sugar turns amber about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat (don't worry if a few lumps of sugar remain). Carefully stir in the coffee mixture until smooth. Pour the caramel into an 8-inch-square baking pan; tilt the pan to coat the bottom and halfway up the sides. Let cool until the caramel is no longer sticky about 10 minutes.
            

              Lay the cake halves cut-side down next to each other on top of the caramel in the prepared pan. Poke the cake all over with a fork.
            

              Whisk the eggs and yolks in a bowl until foamy. Slowly whisk in the condensed milk and evaporated milk until smooth.

Calzone Recipe | Jamie Oliver | Food Network, Just over 2 pounds (1 kilogram) strong bread flour Just over 1 pint (625 milliliters) tepid water 1 ounce (30 grams) fresh yeast or 3 (1/4 ounce/7 gram) sachets dried yeast 2 tablespoons sugar Sea salt Extra flour for dusting 2 courgettes (zucchini) sliced and char-grilled 2 artichoke hearts char-grilled and sliced A handful black olives A handful sun-dried tomatoes A couple slices Parma ham A bunch basil leaves ripped A drizzle olive oil A drizzle herb vinegar 1 ball mozzarella ripped A handful Parmesan shavings A couple fresh plum tomatoes 2 ounces Montgomery cheddar A good drizzle extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper Maldon sea salt ,               For the bread:
            

              Stage 1: Making a Well Pile the flour on to a clean surface and make a large well in the center. Pour half the water into the well then add your yeast sugar and salt and stir with a fork.
            

              Stage 2: Getting It Together Slowly but confidently bring in the flour from the inside of the well. (You do not want to break the walls of the well or the water will go everywhere). Continue to bring the flour into the center until you get a stodgy porridge-y consistency then add the remaining water. Continue to mix until it's stodgy again then you can be more aggressive bringing in all the flour making the mix less sticky. Flour your hands and pat and push the dough together with all the remaining flour. (Certain flours need a little more or less water so feel free to adjust).
            

              Stage 3: Kneading! This is where you get stuck in. With a bit of elbow grease simply push fold slap and roll the dough around over and over for 4 or 5 minutes until you have a silky and elastic dough.
            

              Stage 4: First Proof Flour the top of your dough. Put it in a bowl cover with plastic wrap and allow it to proof in a warm moist draught-free place until doubled in size about half an hour. This proof will improve the flavor and texture of your dough and it's always exciting to know that the old yeast has kicked into action.
            

              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C/gas 4).
            

              Chop and mix all the ingredients for the filling and season well.
            

              Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Roll into balls using flour for dusting. Then roll into little frisbee shapes just over 1/4-inch (0.5 centimeter) thick. Place a good spoonful of your filling into the middle of each brush the edges with a little water then fold the rounds in half pushing their edges to seal. Some people prefer to use a fork to do this but I just pinch them with my fingers. Dust with flour do the same with all the others and move to a flour-dusted baking tray. Allow to sit for 5 minutes then score the top of the bread to allow your filling to bubble over when cooking. Bake in your preheated oven for 20 minutes until golden and scrumptious-looking and allow to cool. Always good for picnics or as portable food.

              Spray a grill basket with olive oil. Grill the chicken breasts over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes until no longer pink in the thickest portion of each breast. Spread the onion rings over the surface of the basket and grill while the chicken is cooking. Turn the basket frequently. The onion rings will blacken as they cook; this will also take 8 to 10 minutes. When the chicken and onion rings are cooked place the pita breads on the grill for about 2 minutes per side until grill marks show. Slice the chicken into very thin pieces.
            

              At serving time put out all of the ingredients and allow each person to assemble sandwiches: Split each pita. Place several slices of grilled chicken 3 or 4 slivers of onion a tablespoon of tomato-feta mixture lettuce olives and 1 or 2 slices of bacon into each pita.

Blueberry-Lemon Pie with a Butter Crust Recipe | Amy Thielen | Food Network, 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour plus more for dusting 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 9 ounces (2 sticks plus 2 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter cut into cubes 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar 6 cups blueberries 3/4 cup sugar plus more for dusting the pie 5 tablespoons cornstarch Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter cut into thin pats Heavy cream for brushing the pie Ice cream for serving , Watch how to make this recipe.


              For the flaky butter pie crust: Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and cut it in with a pastry blender until the largest pieces are the size of small peas and the mixture begins to clump on the pastry blender. Shuffle through the mixture with your hands pinching chunks of fat to flatten them.
            

              Stir the vinegar and 5 tablespoons ice water together in a bowl. Add the liquid to the flour mixture and stir with a fork. Pinch a clump of dough in your hands: If it feels moist and clumps together easily it's probably hydrated enough. If it feels really crumbly add another tablespoon or two of ice water until you can form a baseball-size clump of dough packing it on as if you were making a snowball.
            

              Divide the dough in half and form each half into a flat disk. Wrap both disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.
            

              Thirty minutes before you're ready to roll out the dough remove it from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature to soften. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
            

              For the blueberry filling: In a bowl toss the blueberries with the sugar cornstarch and lemon zest and juice and mix until combined.
            

              Dust a worktop and rolling pin with flour. Roll out one dough disk a little less than 1¿4 inch thick about 14 inches in diameter. Fold the dough in half and transfer it to a 9- or 10-inch pie plate. Unfold. Press the dough into the corners leaving the overhang for now. Refrigerate the first crust while you roll out the second disk of dough.
            

              Remove the bottom crust from the refrigerator and fill it with the berry mixture. Tuck the pats of cold butter beneath the top layer of berries. Top with the second piece of dough and trim both to a 1/2-inch overhang around the pie. Tuck the overhang into a roll and crimp the edge pressing down to hook some of the dough over the edge of the dish holding the pie. Cut a hole in the center of the pie as well as some decorative vents.
            

              Brush the top of the pie with cream and dust it with sugar. Bake for 20 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for another 20 minutes. Cover the edges of the pie with foil and continue to bake until the center juices bubble and thicken 25 to 35 minutes more.
            

              Let the pie cool until it is just warm to the touch before slicing and serving. Top with ice cream.

Gulf Coast Gumbo Recipe | Robert Irvine | Food Network, 1 1/2 quarts (6 cups) chicken stock 1 pound crawfish rinsed well in several changes of cold water and eviscerated 1 pound (31 to 40 size) shrimp deveined 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 pound chorizo sausage 1 large white onion chopped 3 stalks celery diced medium 1 green bell pepper stem and seeds removed and diced medium 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons tomato paste 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 5 or 6 fresh or defrosted fresh frozen okra stem-end removed and sliced 3 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves divided 3 or 4 fresh scallions white and tender green parts only sliced 1 red bell pepper stem and seeds removed and diced medium 3 large fresh tomatoes seeds removed and medium diced 2 dozen shucked oysters 1 pound cooked lump crabmeat picked over for shells 2 cups cooked white rice 1 to 2 tablespoons file powder ,               Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the crayfish a little at a time so as not to stop the boil and let cook until pink. Using a slotted spoon remove the crayfish and set aside until they are cool enough to handle. (Skim off and discard any impurities that have risen to the surface of the stock.) Now remove the shells from the shrimp and add the shells to the pot of chicken stock reserving the uncooked shrimp on a utility platter. Allow the shrimp shells to cook in the broth until pink then strain the stock into another container and discard the shells.
            

              While the shrimp shells are boiling heat the olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Brown the sausage and remove to a platter until it is cool enough to handle. In the sausage drippings over medium heat saute the onion celery and green bell pepper until the onion turns translucent. Reduce the heat and whisk in the flour to make a roux and let cook for about 15 minutes until it becomes a brown roux.
            

              While the roux is browning slice the sausage into 1/4 to 1/2-inch pieces. Put the tomato paste in a small bowl and add some of the warm stock to make a slurry. Gradually whisk the warm stock and the tomato paste into the roux. Add the garlic powder crushed red pepper okra 1 tablespoon parsley scallions red bell pepper tomatoes and sausage. Cook over low heat until the okra - which contains a thickening agent - is tender about 15 minutes and the sausage is cooked through. While the mixture is cooking remove the crayfish from their shells. (This is done by cracking the tail with both hands and forcing it back out through the curve of the tail.) Add the oysters and shrimp to the pot and cook about 5 minutes until the oysters are plump and the shrimp are pink. Stir in crayfish. Remove pot from heat and carefully fold in crab trying not to break up the lumps.
            

              To serve place some rice on serving dish and spoon some gumbo over. Sprinkle with file powder and garnish with remaining parsley.

              Place the pork roast in a roasting pan with the ribs facing up braced against each other. Add sage and thyme to olive oil. Brush the pork roasts with oil mixture and season with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Roast the pork loin for 2 1/2 hours until the skin is crackled. (Put the apples in the oven along with the pork roast in the last half hour of cooking.)
            

              Remove the pork roast to a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving. Pour out some of the excess fat from the roasting pan and put it on the stove over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the flour into the hot pan juices stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps. Cook and stir the roux until its light brown. Add the cider and continue to stir to incorporate. Pour in the chicken broth; boil and stir for 5 minutes until the sauce is thick. Check for seasoning - add lemon juice if necessary. Serve the cider gravy with the pork roast and baked apples.
            

              To make the buttered apples: Core the apples with an apple corer making a good size cavity to hold the stuffing. Douse the cut sides of the apples with some of the lemon juice to prevent them from browning while you make the stuffing. In a mixing bowl combine the softened butter muffin crumbs raisins sage garlic brown sugar salt and pepper. Spoon the stuffing into the cavities of the cored apples; stand them up side by side in a baking dish and sprinkle the tops with the reserved muffin crumbs.

Hard Polenta Cakes Recipe | Anne Burrell | Food Network, 1 cup milk 2 cups water Pinch cayenne pepper 1 bay leaf Kosher salt 1 cup polenta 4 sage leaves finely chopped 1/4 cup mascarpone Extra-virgin olive oil 4 tablespoons grated Parmigiano , Watch how to make this recipe.


              In a saucepan combine the milk water bay and cayenne. Bring the mixture to a boil over low heat and season generously with salt. Take the seasoning to the edge of too salty. To do this you MUST taste as you go. Polenta acts as a salt eraser if you don't season abundantly here you will never recover from it.
            

              Once the liquid is at a boil and is seasoned appropriately sprinkle in the polenta whisking constantly. Once the polenta is combined switch over to a wooden spoon and stir frequently until the polenta has become thick. Taste the polenta to see if it has cooked through. If it still feels mealy and grainy add some more milk or water and cook it to a thick consistency. Repeat this process as needed until the polenta feels smooth on your tongue about 30 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and stir in the chopped sage and mascarpone.
            

              Line a 7 by 7-inch square pan with plastic wrap. Pour the polenta into the prepared pan. Cover the top with more plastic smoothed onto the surface of the polenta. Chill in the refrigerator until needed. (All of this can totally be done ahead of time like yesterday! Cool!)
            

              When ready to use remove the polenta from the pan and cut into desired shapes. Coat a nonstick saute pan with olive oil and bring to medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot and starting to smoke just a little add the polenta shapes. Cook the polenta on both sides and finish by sprinkling with a little bit grated Parmigiano. Transfer to a serving platter and serve while hot.

              Drain the feta cheese from the brine. Cut the block of feta using a thin sharp knife into 6 slices approximately 2 by 4 inches and 1/2-inch thick. Set the slices on a clean kitchen towel to dry.
            

              Lay the phyllo sheets on a flat surface and cut with kitchen scissors or a small sharp knife to size. They should be cut into rectangles approximately 8 by 12 inches. Use a ruler if needed.
            

              Lay 1 cut piece of phyllo in front of you like a sheet of wrapping paper - the 12-inch length top to bottom. Place a slice of feta at the top end of the sheet slightly below the edge and wrap it up as you would a small package. Fold the top end of the sheet over the feta and then fold the left and right sides over. Flip the partly wrapped feta down the sheet towards you until it is fully wrapped. If needed a little water can be used to seal the last edge of the sheet onto itself.
            

              Set aside with the sealed edge on the bottom of the package so the weight keeps the phyllo closed. Do not stack packages on top of each other. Continue to wrap all the pieces of feta.
            

              Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a deep sided skillet using sufficient oil to float the package about 3 to 5 inches of oil. Fry to a golden brown about 5 minutes on each side. The pastry should puff up slightly. Remove with tongs or a slotted spoon and drain on a paper-towel lined plate.
            

              Serve each package on an individual plate or if on a serving platter do not stack the packages. Drizzle each package with about 2 tablespoons of honey and sprinkle with a teaspoon of black sesame seeds. Top with cut pieces of candied fig or a teaspoon of chunky fig jam.

Fried Chicken Recipe | Food Network, 6 to 8 pieces skinless white chicken meat with or without bones 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/3 to 1/2 cup solid vegetable shortening Salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste ,               Trim off all fat and discoloration etc. with kitchen shears or a sharp knife from the chicken. Wash under cold water. Put a cup of full of all-purpose flour into a plastic bag. While the pieces are still very wet place them one at a time into the flour. Shake the bag to coat each piece. Melt about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of shortening in a pan on medium heat. Shake the bag again to keep the pieces from sticking together.
            

              When the shortening is melted and very hot remove the chicken from the bag. Gently shake off the excess flour and lay into the hot fat. When all the pieces are in the pan cover with a lid and allow to fry about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove cover and check each piece to see how brown it is. When it is lightly golden brown turn to fry the other side. Add salt and fresh ground pepper to each piece on the browned side. Cover again and allow the other side to brown. Season the second side. At this point you may remove the cover and continue to fry the chicken to the desired "browness" you prefer. Turn often.
            

              It should be nicely browned with a very crisp outside and a moist tender inside. You may want to reduce the heat a little after you have browned the second side. Boneless skinless chicken gets done much faster than meat with the bone in. Place than fried pieces on a wire rack covered with a paper towel to drain off the excess grease.

              Using a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip pipe the dough onto the baking sheet in 2-inch diameter rounds or balls. Whisk the remaining egg with 1 1/2 teaspoons water. Brush the surface of the rounds with the egg wash to knock down the points (you may not use all the egg wash). Bake 15 minutes then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F and bake until puffed up and light golden brown about 20 minutes more. Try not to open the oven door too often during the baking. Let cool on the baking sheet.
            

              To fill the cream puffs place a pastry tip on your finger and poke a whole in the bottom of each puff. Whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla until stiff. Pipe whipped cream into each cream puff and chill until ready to serve no more than 4 hours.
            

              Notes about the recipe: The moisture in the eggs turns to steam and puffs the batter to try to release itself. You can fill them with anything.

Gumbo Recipe | Guy Fieri | Food Network, 1 (4 to 5-pound) chicken cut into 10 parts reserve neck back and wing tips for stock 1/4 cup kosher salt 3 tablespoons hot sauce (recommended: Crystal) 3 tablespoons liquid smoke 1 tablespoon fresh cracked black pepper 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon fresh cracked black pepper 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 cup 2-inch pieces celery and tips 1 carrot cut into 4 pieces 1 onion quartered 1 jalapeno cut in half seeds removed 1 1/2 tablespoons liquid smoke 1 pound smoked sausage cut into 1/2-inch slices on the bias 1 pound andouille sausage cut into 1/2-inch slices on the bias 1/4 cup bacon fat 4 cups diced onions 2 cups diced celery 2 cups diced green bell pepper 2 cups diced red bell pepper 1/4 cup fine diced Anaheim pepper 1 cup minced garlic 3/4 cup flour 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon ground white pepper 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon fresh cracked black pepper Cooked rice for serving Chopped fresh parsley for garnish , Watch how to make this recipe.


              For the brine: Combine the chicken pieces salt hot sauce liquid smoke and black pepper with 4 cups water in a large resealable bag and place inside a container (in case of leaks). Refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours. Drain and discard the brine.
            

              For the stock: If you have the time allow the chicken to drain and dry out about 30 minutes prior to searing. It will create a better crust on the chicken and more brown bits on the bottom of the pot ultimately adding more flavor to the gumbo.
            

              Sprinkle the chicken pieces including the reserved neck back and wing tips with the salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven (enameled cast iron preferred) heat the oil over high heat until shimmering. Add the chicken pieces and brown well on all sides turning as needed. Add the celery carrots onions and jalapenos and continue to brown for an additional 10 minutes. Add 1 gallon water and the liquid smoke and bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to maintain a strong simmer. Cook for 1 1/2 hours stirring occasionally.
            

              After 1 1/2 hours remove the chicken pieces discarding the back neck and wing tips. Strain the stock and reserve. When the chicken is cool enough to handle remove the meat and shred discarding the bones and fat.
            

              For the gumbo: In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat add the sausages and cook until the fat has rendered down about 5 minutes. Remove the sausages from the pan and set aside. Add the bacon fat and when shimmering add the onions celery bell peppers and Anaheim peppers. Saute stirring frequently until the onions are just starting to color 10 to 12 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes more being careful not to let it burn. Add the flour 1/4 cup at a time stirring constantly. Stir until a dark golden roux has developed 11 to 13 minutes. Add 1 cup at a time of the stock incorporating well after each addition to total 6 cups.
            

              Add the reserved sausages shredded chicken cayenne and white pepper into the pot. Heat through and add the salt and black pepper. If the gumbo is too thick add a bit more stock to the pot a little at a time until the desired consistency is reached.
            

              Serve over rice and garnish with parsley.

Pour into a small serving bowl and top with the sliced chile pepper. Set aside to let the flavors blend while making the flatbread. Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the sesame seeds. Cook stirring until toasted about 3 minutes. Pour into a small bowl. Add the scallions and remaining 1 teaspoon sesame oil to the bowl and set aside. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface until it is about 1/8-inch thick.

You should be able to see the filling through the dough when it is thin enough and the pieces should be 7 to 8 inches in diameter although they need not be round. Heat 1/2 tablespoon of the canola oil over medium-high heat in the same skillet the sesame seeds cooked in. When very hot add a piece of the dough and cook turning once until it is puffed and cooked through and has some charred spots about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and repeat with the remaining pieces of dough adding more canola oil as needed to just lightly coat the bottom of the skillet and reducing the heat if the dough starts to burn before it cooks through. Cut the flatbreads into pieces and serve with the dip and cooked shrimp.

Bake the potatoes until tender enough to be pierced easily with a wooden skewer about 45 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and leave them for a few minutes to cool slightly. Leave the oven on.
            

              Heat a saute pan over high heat. Add the olive oil and as soon as it swirls easily add the butter. When the butter foams add the ham and mushrooms and saute until they are hot 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the ham and mushrooms to a small mixing bowl.
            

              Using a small sharp knife and protecting your hand from the heat with a folded kitchen towel carefully cut off the lids from the still-hot baked potatoes following the scoring marks. With a sharp-edged tablespoon scoop the flesh from the potatoes including the lids leaving a wall about 1/4-inch thick and transferring the scooped-out flesh to a large mixing bowl. Return the potato shells and lids to the bed of rock salt. Put the tray back in the hot oven leaving the oven door open to keep the potato shells and lids warm.
            

              With a potato masher mash the potatoes. Season the mixture to taste with salt and generously with pepper. Add the creme fraiche or sour cream and the butter and mash to combine them with the potatoes. Stir in the ham mushrooms and 2 ounces of the cheese.
            

              Remove the baking sheet from the oven and turn the temperature up to 500 degrees F.
            

              Carefully spoon the mashed potato mixture back into each potato shell. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top of the filling on each potato. Leave the lids unfilled placing them around the side of the tray.
            

              Return the tray to the oven and continue baking the potatoes until they are heated through and the cheese has melted 7 to 10 minutes. If the cheese has not browned turn on the broiler and broil the potatoes briefly keeping a close eye on them to prevent burning.
            

              Using tongs transfer the potatoes to a heated serving platter or individual plates. Place the lids on top of the potatoes at an angle inserting 1 end partway into the filling to secure them.

              Using a warmed sharp knife or unflavored dental floss (See Cook's Note 1) cut the wheel of brie in half horizontally and separate the top half of the wheel from the bottom half. Sprinkle the bottom half of the brie with the dried cherries toasted almonds and brown sugar. Replace the top half of the brie and apply pressure to secure the stuffing. Working on a well-floured surface roll out the puff pastry so that it will fully cover the brie. Place the brie in the middle of the puff pastry and fold the excess pastry around the wheel. Put the wheel aside. Roll out another piece of puff pastry and cut out a circle the same circumference as the top of the brie. Save the trimmings for decorations. Using a pastry brush brush the egg on top of the brie in the puff pastry and place the circle on top. Brush the top of the circle with egg. Cut out decorations using cookie cutters or a small knife on top of the brie. Brush the entire top side of the brie with the egg and place the brie on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.

Then take a long piece of dental floss and wrap it around both hands. Starting at the front of the wheel at the initial cut work through the wheel with the floss separating the top half of the wheel from the bottom.

Slow-Cooker Swedish Meatballs Recipe | Food Network Kitchen | Food Network, 1 cup beef broth 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 pound ground pork 1 pound ground turkey 1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs 2 large eggs 1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice 1 teaspoon onion powder Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/4 cup sour cream 1 tablespoon lingonberry or red currant jelly optional 1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves chopped ,               Add the beef broth and Worcestershire sauce to a 6-quart slow cooker.
            

              Add the pork turkey breadcrumbs eggs allspice onion powder 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to a large bowl. Mix the meat with your hands until the mixture is uniform in color and texture. Scoop level tablespoonfuls and roll them into balls; place them in a single layer in the slow cooker. When the bottom of the cooker is covered add a second layer starting on the outer edge. (The outside of the cooker is hotter; meatballs on the edge will cook more quickly than those in the center.) Cover and cook on high for 2 hours until the meatballs are cooked through.
            

              Meanwhile rub the butter and flour together in a small bowl to make a smooth paste (which will be used to thicken the sauce). Pinch off 1/2-inch balls and set on a small plate.
            

              Transfer the meatballs with a slotted spoon from the slow cooker to a large bowl leaving the cooking liquid in the pot. (You should have about 1 1/2 cups liquid.) When removing the meatballs start from the outer edges and scoop carefully. Some may be stuck together; gentle coaxing with the spoon will separate them.
            

              Whisk the butter-flour paste into the cooking liquid 1 or 2 balls at a time to incorporate. Whisk in the sour cream and jelly if using. Return the meatballs to the slow cooker and stir with the spoon to coat. Cook on high uncovered until the sauce is thickened 30 minutes. Adjust the setting to keep warm sprinkle the meatballs with the parsley and serve.

Six Foot Sundae Recipe | Ree Drummond | Food Network, 1 quart vanilla ice cream 1 quart mint chip ice cream 1 quart strawberry ice cream 2 recipes Dark Chocolate Brownie Bites recipe follows Strawberry Sauce recipe follows for drizzling Hot Fudge Sauce recipe follows for drizzling Rainbow sprinkles for sprinkling Canned whipped cream for topping Maraschino cherries for topping Nonstick cooking spray for greasing the pan 4 sticks (2 cups) salted butter 10 ounces unsweetened chocolate chopped 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 4 cups sugar 2 tablespoons vanilla 6 large eggs 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips 4 pounds strawberries hulled 2 cups sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla 1 lemon juiced 2 cups sugar 2 cups heavy cream 2 cups dark cocoa powder 2 sticks (1 cup) salted butter , Watch how to make this recipe.

Special equipment: a 6-foot piece of guttering

              Several hours before you're ready to assemble the sundae portion out 12 scoops of each type of ice cream--vanilla mint chip and strawberry--onto baking sheets (36 scoops total) and freeze them. This will make it much easier to handle.
            

              Line the guttering with heavy-duty aluminum foil.
            

              To assemble place a layer of Dark Chocolate Brownie Bites in the bottom of the guttering. Top with the ice cream scoops and scatter over more brownie bites. Drizzle with Strawberry Sauce and Hot Fudge Sauce. Sprinkle with rainbow sprinkles. Squirt mounds of whipped cream across the sundae and top each mound with a cherry.
            

Dark Chocolate Brownie Bites:


              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 18-by-13-inch pan (half sheet pan) with cooking spray.
            

              In a medium-large saucepan heat the butter and unsweetened chocolate over low heat whisking occasionally until smooth and melted. Sprinkle in the cocoa powder and whisk to combine. Remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool for about 5 minutes.
            

              Stir the sugar and vanilla into the chocolate mixture until just combined. One at a time stir in the eggs. Gently stir in the flour until halfway incorporated. Add the chocolate chips and stir just until combined.
            

              Pour the batter (it will be very thick!) into the prepared pan spreading to even out the top. Bake for 30 minutes then check the brownies with a toothpick. If they are overly gooey/messy return to the oven for 5 to 10 more minutes (just be careful not to burn the edges). Allow to cool completely (important!) then cut into small squares.
            

Strawberry Sauce:


              Place the strawberries sugar vanilla and lemon juice in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a gentle boil stirring constantly and cook until the strawberries are very soft a good 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and use a potato masher to completely smush them to smithereens. Pour the mixture into a fine-mesh strainer placed over a bowl. Use a spoon to stir the fruit so the liquid is forced through. Continue until almost all of the liquid is in the bowl. Set the pulp aside.
            

              Skim as much foam off the sauce as you can. Pour the skimmed sauce back into the same saucepan add 1/4 cup of the pulp back in and boil again for 3 minutes over medium-high heat. Skim off any more foam that has formed on the surface then allow the sauce to cool slightly before pouring it into a pitcher or jar. Refrigerate it to thicken and serve it cold.
            

Hot Fudge Sauce:


              Combine the sugar cream cocoa and butter in a small saucepot over medium heat and cook stirring until the butter melts and everything is combined a few minutes.
            

              Transfer to a mason jar and store in the refrigerator. It will harden as it cools so when ready to use simply reheat in a saucepan over medium-low heat.

Stuffed Sweet Potato Bites Recipe | Food Network, 1/2 package frozen sweet potato fries chopped into small cubes 1 cup grated sharp Cheddar 1/4 cup honey 1/2 cup all-purpose flour plus extra for drudging 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs plus extra for drudging 1 egg plus 2 eggs for drudging 2 teaspoons salt 1 tablespoon bacon salt seasoning 1 tablespoon cold butter chopped into small cubes Canola oil for frying 1 cup sour cream 1 package bacon ranch dip mix , Special equipment: 1 kitchen syringe (think turkey syringe at Thanksgiving)

              In a large mixing bowl add the chopped sweet potato fries Cheddar honey 1/2 cup of flour 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs 1 egg salt bacon salt seasoning and chilled butter and begin to mix rigorously with your hands. When the items are incorporated properly you can begin to form bite-size balls with the mixture. If the sweet potato mixture is not forming properly add more flour and mix again. After forming the balls put them on a plate side by side until all the mixture is used. When the plate is filled wrap in plastic wrap and put it in the freezer for at least 1 hour. While the balls are freezing prepare a "dredging" station. This should consist of (in this order) 1 bowl of seasoned flour (seasoning with salt and pepper is fine you can also add more bacon salt seasoning) 1 bowl with 2 beaten eggs and 1 bowl with seasoned panko bread crumbs (same seasoning as flour). When the bites are frozen begin the drudging process. You do this by rolling the balls in the flour then dipping in the egg then rolling them in the bread crumbs. Repeat this process with all the sweet potato bites. Fill a frying pan half way full with canola oil. Heat the oil to about 350 to 375 degrees F. When the proper temperature is achieved gently drop the bites into the oil and cook until the entire outer layer of the bite is a golden brown. Transfer the bites to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. When all the balls have been fried and are cooling take a small mixing bowl and mix the sour cream and the bacon ranch dip mix until it is totally incorporated. Take the tip of the kitchen syringe and put in the dip; pull the lever to transfer the dip into the shaft of the syringe. Insert the needlepoint of the syringe into the center of a sweet potato bite then gently inject the dip into the bite. You may need to experiment with 1 or 2 bites before you get the technique down. You want to slightly fill the bite but not overstuff it to the point where the dip leaks out. Continue this process until all the bites have been filled. Arrange the bits on a serving platter and serve warm.

Over-the-Coals Bourbon, Blueberry and Peach Cobbler Recipe | Guy Fieri | Food Network, 6 cups sliced peaches (about 5 peaches) 3/4 cup blueberries 1/4 cup bourbon (or dark rum) 1/4 cup sugar 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup rolled oats 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) cold unsalted butter cut into small cubes 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1 quart good-quality vanilla yogurt for serving ,               Start a campfire and wait until the flames die down and the coals glow red with white ash. Meanwhile make the filling: In a large bowl combine the peaches blueberries bourbon sugar cornstarch cinnamon lemon zest lemon juice and vanilla. Mix well to coat the peaches and blueberries evenly. Set aside.
            

              Make the topping: In a second large bowl combine the flour oats sugar and salt. Add the cold butter cubes and cut the butter into the flour with a pastry blender 2 knives or your hands. Mix until the texture is coarse and clumps in your palm when you squeeze a handful. Add the heavy cream and mix just until the dough comes together a bit more.
            

              Pour the filling into a 12-inch cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven with a fitted lid and spread it out evenly. Spoon the topping mixture evenly over the filling then cover with the lid. Place the skillet adjacent to the hot coals in a place where it will get a good amount of radiant heat so the topping cooks through evenly without burning. Use a metal shovel to pile hot coals on top of the lid (this will distribute heat from the top). Cook 45 to 50 minutes rotating the skillet 90 degrees every 10 minutes so the cobbler cooks evenly. (Feed the fire with more wood as needed.) Change out the hot coals on top 2 or 3 times during cooking so the top stays hot throughout. When the cobbler is done the fruit will be bubbling around the edges and the topping will be light and fluffy. Serve the cobbler straight from the pan with vanilla yogurt on the side.
            

              You can also bake the cobbler uncovered in a 375 degrees F oven 30 to 35 minutes.

Stir 2 tablespoons of the spinach puree into the spinach juice and reserve. Discard the remaining puree.
            

              Combine the flours in the food processor with salt. With the motor running add the eggs olive oil and enough of the spinach mixture through the feed tube so that the dough forms a ball pressed together. Wrap the dough in plastic and let it rest at room temperature for at least 2 hours.
            

              Divide the dough into 4 pieces and roll and cut 1 at a time as desired. Keep. The unrolled dough covered to prevent it from drying. Place any cut pasta on baking sheets that have been liberally dusted with semolina.
            

Regular Pasta Dough:


              Place the flours in a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Add the salt eggs and olive oil. Process until the dough begins to mass on the blade (about 1-2 minutes).
            

              Remove the dough from the processor and press it into a ball. Wrap in plastic and let rest at least 2 hours in the refrigerator before rolling and cutting. (Rolling the dough by hand is extremely tedious; with a small pasta machine and cutting attachment you will save time and produce a much more uniform product.)
            

              Notes: The pasta can be made by hand or in an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. For each of these methods mix the dry ingredients together first make a well in the center add the wet ingredients and mix them together slowly until everything is combined well. Wrap in a plastic.
            

Chicken Stock:


              In a stockpot place the chicken bones then add all the remaining ingredients except the water. Add water to cover by 2 inches bring it to a boil and reduce the heat. Simmer the mixture for 2 or 3 hours skimming the surface scum form the stock as it collects.
            

              Strain the stock into a clean pot and grease it thoroughly. Bring the stock to a boil and reduce it over moderate heat to 2 quarters.

Apple Pie Recipe | Food Network Kitchen | Food Network, 3 pounds mixed apples (such as Golden Delicious McIntosh and Pink Lady) 2/3 cup sugar 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch of ground cloves Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour plus more for dusting 1/4 cup sugar plus more for sprinkling 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup vegetable shortening 1 stick cold unsalted butter cut into 1/2-inch pieces 2 large eggs ,               Prepare the filling: Peel halve and core the apples. Cut each half into 6 wedges and toss with the sugar and lemon juice in a bowl. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apple mixture and cook stirring occasionally until the firmer apples begin to soften but still hold their shape 8 to 9 minutes. Sprinkle with the flour cinnamon cloves and nutmeg and toss until the juices begin to thicken about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and cool completely. (The filling can be made up to 2 days ahead; cover and refrigerate.)
            

              Make the dough: Pulse the flour sugar and salt in a food processor until combined. Add the shortening and pulse until it disappears about 30 seconds. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter. Beat 1 egg with 1/4 cup ice water in a bowl then add to the processor and pulse once or twice. (Stop before the dough gathers into a ball.) Lay out 2 sheets of plastic wrap; divide the dough between the sheets and pat each into a disk. Wrap the disks tightly and refrigerate until firm at least 1 hour.
            

              Roll 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a floured surface (or between 2 pieces of floured parchment paper). Ease into a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish glass pie plate. Add the filling mounding it slightly and dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Chill the pie while you roll the remaining dough into a 12-inch round.
            

              Lay the dough over the filling and press the 2 crusts together around the edges. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp with your fingers. Beat the remaining egg in a bowl and brush over the top crust; sprinkle with sugar. Pierce the top with a knife a few times to let steam escape. Chill 30 minutes.
            

              Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the pie on a baking sheet; bake until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbly 55 to 60 minutes. (Cover the edges with foil if they brown too quickly.) Transfer to a rack and cool until set 2 hours.

New England Fish Chowder Recipe | Food Network, 4 ounces meaty salt pork rind removed and cut into 1/3-inch dice 2 tablespoons butter 2 medium onions cut into 3/4-inch dice 6 to 8 sprigs fresh summer savory or thyme leaves removed and chopped (1 tablespoon) 2 dried bay leaves 2 pounds all-purpose potatoes such as Yukon gold peeled and sliced 1/3-inch thick 5 cups Strong Fish Stock recipe follows Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground pepper 3 pounds skinless haddock or cod fillets preferably over 1-inch thick pin bones removed 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 2 tablespoons finely chopped Italian parsley leaves 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives 2 tablespoons butter 2 medium onions very thinly sliced 4 stalks celery very thinly sliced 2 medium carrots peeled and very thinly sliced 2 dried bay leaves 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves and stems 6 to 8 sprigs fresh thyme 2 tablespoons black peppercorns 1 large (6 inches long or more) or 2 small (4 inches long or less) fish heads from cod or haddock split lengthwise gills removed and rinsed clean of any blood. 2 1/2 to 3 pounds fish bones from sole flounder bass and/or halibut cut into 2-inch pieces and rinsed clean of any blood 1/4 cup dry white wine Kosher or sea salt ,               Heat a 4 to 6 quart heavy pot over low heat and add the diced salt pork. Once it has rendered a few tablespoons of fat increase the heat to medium and cook until the pork is a crisp golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cracklings to a small ovenproof dish; reserve.
            

              Add the butter onions savory or thyme and bay leaves to the fat in the pot and cook over medium heat stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon until the onions have softened but not browned about 8 minutes.
            

              Add the potatoes and stock. If the stock doesn't cover the potatoes add a little water. Turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Cover the pot and boil the potatoes vigorously until they are soft on the outside but still firm in the center about 10 minutes. If the stock hasn't thickened slightly smash a few of the potato slices against the side of the pot and cook for 1 to 2 minutes longer.
            

              Reduce the heat to low and season assertively with salt and pepper (you want to almost over season at this point in order to avoid having to stir once the fish is added). Add the fish fillets and cook over a low heat until the fish is almost done 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the chowder to sit for 10 minutes (the fish will finish cooking during this time).
            

              Gently stir in the cream and taste for salt and pepper. If you are not serving the chowder within the hour let it cool a bit then refrigerate (only cover the chowder after it has chilled completely). Otherwise let it sit for up to an hour at room temperature allowing the flavors to meld.
            

              When ready to serve reheat the chowder over a low heat; don't let it boil. Warm the cracklings in a low oven (220 degrees F) for a few minutes.
            

              Use a slotted spoon to mound the chunks of fish the onions and potatoes in the center of large soup plates or shallow bowls ladle the creamy broth around and scatter the cracklings over top. Finish each serving with a sprinkling of chopped parsley and minced chives.
            

Strong Fish Stock:


              Melt the butter in a heavy 7 to 8-quart stockpot over medium heat. Add the onions celery carrots bay leaves parsley thyme and peppercorns and cook stirring frequently with a wooden spoon until the vegetables become very soft without browning about 8 minutes.
            

              Place the fish head on the vegetables and stack the fish frames evenly on top. Pour in the wine cover the pot tightly and let the bones sweat until they have turned completely white 10 to 15 minutes.
            

              Add enough very hot or boiling water (approximately 2 quarts) to just barely cover the bones. Give the mixture a gentle stir and allow the brew to come to a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes uncovered carefully skimming off any white foam that comes to the surface (try to leave the herbs spices and vegetables in the pot).
            

              Remove the pot from the stove stir the stock again and allow it to steep undisturbed for 10 minutes. Ladle through a fine-mesh strainer and season lightly with salt. If you are not going to be using the stock within the hour chill it as quickly as possible.
            

              Cover the stock after it is thoroughly chilled (it will have a light jellied consistency) and keep refrigerated for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 2 months.

Grilled Chicken Cordon Bleu Recipe | Food Network, 4 boneless skinless chicken breast 1 pound bacon 1 large onion (Vidalia are the best) sliced into rings 10 oz crumbled blue cheese mushrooms raspberry vinaigrette garlic salt seasoned salt black pepper parmesan cheese freshly grated , Special equipment: aluminum foil toothpicks

              Remove all the fat from the chicken. Using a meat tenderizer pound chicken until it is all one thickness--the thinner the better. Season the chicken front and back with garlic salt and pepper. Take the seasoned chicken place in a bowl and cover with raspberry vinaigrette. Let sit in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours. Turn chicken every once in a while to make sure it is coated with the vinaigrette marinade.
            

              After marinating remove chicken. Evenly sprinkle a thin layer of blue cheese over each breast. Pepper the chicken. Slowly roll up the chicken and secure with a toothpick. Take a piece of bacon wrap around the chicken and secure again with toothpick. Continue rolling all chicken breasts.
            

              On a large sheet of aluminum foil spread rings of onion in the center and sprinkle with mushrooms. Drizzle with raspberry vinaigrette. Set chicken bundles on onions and mushrooms and drizzle with more raspberry vinaigrette. Season with seasoned salt. Cover with more foil and fold in the sides so it creates a pouch and the juices do not escape.
            

              Throw on grill and occasionally turn for the next 25 to 45 minutes ( depending on how hot your grill is). When done crack the top of the foil open and sprinkle freshly grated parmesan over the chicken. Serve. I hope you enjoy.

              Dust each chicken roll lightly with flour then dip in the egg wash and then roll in the panko. Once all the chicken rolls have been breaded let them hang out in the fridge for at least 1 hour.
            

              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              Add olive oil to a large straight-sided saute pan until it reaches a depth of 1/2-inch and bring the pan to a medium-high heat.

Chicken Milanese with Escarole Salad Recipe | Anne Burrell | Food Network, High-quality extra-virgin olive oil 2 slices prosciutto 1/2 cup toasted hazelnuts 1/2 cup grated pecorino 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 1 head escarole washed spun dry cut into bite-size pieces Pickled Red Onions recipe follows Kosher salt 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 eggs beaten with 1 tablespoon water 1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 4 small organic chicken breast halves butterflied lightly pounded 1/4-inch thick Kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil for frying 1/2 cup red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon sugar 2 to 3 really good shots hot sauce such as Tabasco 1 red onion sliced into very thin rings , Chicken Milanese:


              For the escarole salad: Set a small saute pan over medium heat; coat with olive oil. Add the prosciutto and cook until crispy. Remove from the pan and set aside.
            

              Combine the hazelnuts pecorino and parsley in a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped. In a bowl toss together the escarole hazelnut mixture and some pickled red onions. Dress with some red onion pickling liquid and olive oil. Season with salt and garnish with crispy prosciutto.
            

              For the chicken Milanese: Set up a standard breading station in three wide deep plates. Fill one plate with the flour a second with the beaten eggs and a third with the panko and Parmesan. Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt. Using one hand for dry things and one hand for wet things take each piece of chicken through the breading procedure: Dredge lightly in the flour then in the egg wash and then through the breadcrumbs. Lay the breaded chicken on a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
            

              Pour olive oil into a large saute pan until it reaches a depth of about 1/2 inch--better a little more than a little less. Bring the oil to medium-high heat. Test by flicking flour or breadcrumbs into it; if it doesn't sizzle WAIT! When the oil is hot test it again by dipping the edge of a piece of chicken; the oil should sizzle gently. In batches cook the chicken on both sides until crispy and a lovely golden brown 4 to 5 minutes. (Do not crowd the pan or the chicken will become very greasy and soggy.) When the chicken comes out of the oil drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. If you like keep the chicken warm in a low oven while the rest of the chicken is cooking.
            

              Place the chicken serving plates and top with escarole salad.
            

Pickled Red Onions:


              In a small bowl combine the red wine vinegar with 1/2 cup cold tap water. Stir in the salt sugar and hot sauce. Add the sliced onions and let sit for at least 1 hour.

Test one first to be sure it will withstand the heat of the oven. 4-ounce ramekins may be used as a substitute if necessary.) ,               For the lemon curd: Beat the eggs and sugar in a small stainless steel or copper pot (do not use aluminum as it will leave deposits in your curd!). Add the lemon juice zest and butter. Bring to a high simmer and cook until mixture thickens. Strain immediately through a sieve or cheesecloth. Spoon 1-ounce of curd into each of the 10 martini glasses. This is best done while the curd is warm but can also be done once it's cooled if necessary. Chill the glasses with the curd until the curd is cold and set.
            

              For the custard: Split the vanilla bean with a paring knife and scrape the seeds into the sugar. Use your fingers to work the beans into the sugar ¿ making an even mixture. Mix this mixture with the egg yolks and the eggs. Don't whip it but be sure to completely mix it so the color is consistent throughout. Bring the cream to a boil remove from the heat and slowly pour it into the egg mixture stirring constantly. Add the vanilla extract.
            

              To bake the creme brulee: Pour 3 ounces of the warm custard mixture into each of the glasses (over the lemon curd). Find a deep pan (preferably at least 6 inches deep. Restaurant supply stores commonly sell these as "hotel" or "insert" pans) and place the filled martini glasses in them. Set the pan on the bottom shelf of a 325 degrees F oven. Using a water pitcher pour enough water into the pan to at least cover the stems of the glasses - ideally you can pour enough to come up about 1/3 of the way on the part of the glass the holds the custard. Baking times will vary depending on the amount of water in the pan and the type of pan used but will be somewhere around 45 minutes to 1 hour. The custard is done when you tap the side of the glass and it looks thick and moves as one (as opposed to the center of the custard giggling more than the outside). Carefully remove the pan from the oven and let cool at room temperature for about 1 hour. Transfer creme brulees into the refrigerator to cool and set completely.
            

              To finish the creme brulee: Sprinkle about a tablespoon of sugar over each of the custards. Use your finger to spread it evenly over the top. Light a blowtorch and turn it to the high setting. Melt and caramelize the sugar quickly. Note that a flame that is too low or prolonged heat towards the edge of the martini glass may break the glass. Use caution and practice on one away from the others so that if it does break you don't get glass in the other custards. Creme brulees can be caramelized ("burnt") up to 4 hours before service and held in the refrigerator.

Chocolate Swan, Treasure Chest, Picture Frame, Chocolate Sleigh, and Dressy Chocolate Box Recipe | Food Network, 5 pounds white chocolate tempered 5 pounds bittersweet chocolate tempered 8 pounds milk chocolate tempered Cocoa butter Powdered food coloring as desired Modeling chocolate white ,               To mold the swan: Use a ladle to fill a mold with white chocolate. When it is full empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden about 5 minutes scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Depending on the thickness of the chocolate you may want to repeat this step to make the swan thicker. Unmold the chocolate swan. When the chocolate has completely set the swans are ready to fill with candy. To mold the treasure chest: Use a clean paintbrush or pastry brush to apply dark chocolate to the inside details of the mold. I painted the hinges and fasteners dark chocolate. Use a ladle to fill a mold with milk chocolate. Use the same molding technique as used in the swan. You can fill the chest with candy or any special treat. Tie it closed with a ribbon. To make the picture and frame: This technique can be used to make any painted design. I downloaded a clipart image from the internet. A simple design with a lot of color makes the best result. Place your design underneath a piece of acetate. Mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a fine-tipped paintbrush to trace the outline of the painting with a dark-colored paint. Use other paint colors to fill in the design. This will certainly remind you of paint-by-number. Use and airbrush if you want to give it an antique finish. Allow the paint to dry. Pour some white chocolate at the edge of the painted acetate. Pull the raplette through the chocolate pulling the chocolate over the painted drawing. This will spread an even 1/8-inch thick layer of chocolate over the painting. When the chocolate begins to set use a sharp paring knife to cut the paint canvas to the finished size of the painting. Let this cool until the chocolate sets. When the chocolate has set completely simply peel off the acetate. Use a brush dipped in dark chocolate to brush a very light layer of dark chocolate over the relief of the picture frame mold. Use a ladle or cornet filled with white chocolate to fill the mold with white chocolate. When the chocolate sets unmold the picture frame. The dark chocolate will leave an antique effect. Use tempered white chocolate to glue the chocolate canvas into the frame. It is ready for display. Make the sleigh: Make a template for the sleigh skis and the sleigh bottom. You can make this any size that you like. The bottom of my sleigh measured 11 inches wide by 17 inches long. I used a wood grain tool normally used in house painting to give the sleigh the texture of wood. To make the wood grain chocolate pour a little dark chocolate at the edge of a piece of parchment paper that measures at least 11 inches wide by 17 inches long. Use a back and forth rocking motion as you pull the wood grain tool through dark chocolate. Be sure to spread this chocolate all the way to the edge of the paper. Repeat the process until the paper is completely filled with the pattern. Repeat on more parchment to create enough wood grain pattern for all of the pieces in your sleigh.
            

              Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered milk chocolate over all of the pieces that have the dark chocolate wood grain pattern. When cutting out the skis use a paring knife to cut through the chocolate while tracing around the template. When the chocolate has set completely remove the excess chocolate. When the chocolate is set peel off the parchment. Make the sleigh handle: Roll parchment paper into a tight roll that is about 1/2-inch in diameter. Use a cornet filled with milk chocolate to fill the roll. Be sure to pinch the bottom to keep the chocolate from escaping. Set aside until the roll has set. When the chocolate is hard remove the parchment paper. Use a hot knife to cut the sleigh handle to the size that will fit onto your sleigh. Assemble: Lay a ski pattern-side down on the work surface. Place tempered milk chocolate in a large cornet and trim the tip. Draw a line of chocolate along the edge of the sleigh bottom. Position the sleigh bottom onto the ski. Draw a line of chocolate on the other edge of the sleigh and position the other ski on top. When the chocolate sets stand the sleigh upright. Use tempered milk chocolate to glue the sleigh handle into place. The sleigh is ready for any display. Make the Dressy Gift box: To make the strips on the top you can use a tiling spatula with square teeth cut from it. My box measured 7 inches wide by 10 inches long. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of tempered milk chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Pull the slotted spatula through the chocolate along the longest side. This will leave long straight lines. When the chocolate begins to set use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over strips being careful not to press into the milk chocolate strips. Let the chocolate set completely. To make the base use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered dark chocolate over a sheet of parchment paper. Use a paring knife to cut a rectangle that measures 7 inches wide by 10 inches. Then cut 2 strips that measure 61/2 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. Cut 2 more strips that measure 91/2 inches long and 11/2 inches wide. When the chocolate has set completely remove the base and strips. Use tempered chocolate to glue the strips onto the base to form a box. Place the strips just inside the edge of the base. Make the box decorations: Use white modeling chocolate to make the tie collar pocket and pocket square. I colored some modeling chocolate red for the pocket square. Get creative and have fun. Dust the work surface with cornstarch. Use a rolling pin to roll out the white modeling chocolate until it is about 1/8-inch thick. Use a paring knife to cut out the details of the shirt or blouse. Place the pieces on top of the striped chocolate box top. If you are inspired to do so paint some patterns on the tie. When the chocolate has set completely on all of the pieces the box is ready to be filled with any treat. Simply fill the box and cover with the top piece.

Checkered Cookies in the Style of Piemonte: Baci di Dama Recipe | Mario Batali | Food Network, 1/2 cup thinly sliced almonds 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/3 cup unsalted butter room temperature 1/4 cup bittersweet dark chocolate melted ,               Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              In the bowl of a food processor combine the almonds sugar flour and butter. Pulse lightly until the almonds are ground and the mixture is homogenous. Place the mixture in a mixing bowl.
            

              Using a tablespoon place small scoops of the mixture on a lightly greased baking sheet separating each scoop by at least 1-inch on all sides. Use the tips of your fingers to gently flatten the tops of each scoop. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature.
            

              Once the cookies have cooled gently melt the chocolate in the bowl of a bain-marie (a stainless steel bowl fitted over a saucepan of simmering water s that the bowl just touches the water). Remove the melted chocolate from the heat. Carefully pour or spoon a bit of melted chocolate on the tops of half the cookies. If the tops are not flat enough simply spoon the melted chocolate on the sides of the cookies that were face down during the cooking process. Use the remaining cookie halves to form the other half of the cookie "sandwich" pressing gently so that the chocolate adheres to both sides of the sandwich. Let rest until the chocolate has cooled holding the cookies together.

Cranberry Pomegranate Terrine Recipe | Food Network Kitchen | Food Network, 1 8-ounce bag fresh cranberries 3/4 cup sugar 2 cups pure pomegranate juice 1 cinnamon stick 2 whole black peppercorns 2 large strips orange peel white pith removed plus strips of zest for garnish Salt 3 packets (6 teaspoons) unflavored gelatin ,               Pulse the cranberries and 1/4 cup sugar in a food processor until chunky and juicy about 8 times. Set aside for 20 minutes to macerate.
            

              Meanwhile combine the remaining 1/2 cup sugar 1 1/2 cups pomegranate juice the cinnamon stick peppercorns orange peel and a pinch of salt in a saucepan over medium heat; simmer stirring until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat; let steep for 20 minutes. Discard the cinnamon peppercorns and orange peel.
            

              Place the remaining 1/2 cup pomegranate juice and 1/4 cup cold water in a bowl and sprinkle the gelatin on top. Set aside without stirring until the gelatin softens about 5 minutes. Add the steeped pomegranate juice to the gelatin mixture and stir until the gelatin dissolves.
            

              Spread a thin layer of the cranberry mixture in a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan; pour in enough of the pomegranate-gelatin mixture to cover (about 3/4 cup). Refrigerate until just beginning to set about 30 minutes. Meanwhile stir the remaining cranberries into the remaining gelatin mixture and set aside unrefrigerated. Once the bottom layer is set pour in the remaining gelatin mixture and refrigerate until completely set at least 2 hours or overnight.
            

              To serve run a knife around the edges of the pan and invert the terrine onto a platter. (Set the pan in warm water to soften the gelatin if necessary.) Garnish with the orange zest.

Fideos Recipe | Kelsey Nixon | Food Network, 2 cloves garlic 2 teaspoons smoked paprika Kosher salt 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (about 1 lemon) plus more as needed 2 egg yolks 2 cups canola oil 1 pound head-on large shrimp (16/20) peeled and deveined heads and shells reserved Pinch saffron 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons butter 1 pound vermicelli noodles broken into 2-inch pieces 8 ounces chorizo cut into 1/4-inch coins 1 medium onion finely chopped 4 cloves garlic minced 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes Kosher salt 1/2 cup dry white wine One 14 1/2-ounce can diced tomatoes drained 2 cups low-sodium chicken stock 8 ounces asparagus trimmed of woody stems cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 pound mussels cleaned and de-bearded 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley Lemon wedges for garnish , Special equipment: a large (15-inch) paella pan

              For the aioli: Add the garlic paprika and a pinch of salt to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until the garlic is finely chopped. Add the lemon juice and egg yolks and pulse until combined.
            

              With the motor running slowly add the oil in a thin stream. Do not rush this step; it should it should take about 1 minute. If the oil is added too quickly the aioli may break. Season with more salt and lemon juice as needed. Serve cold or at room temperature. The aioli may be stored in the fridge for up to 2 days.
            

              For the shrimp stock: Combine the shrimp heads and shells and 2 cups water in a small saucepot. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the saffron. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes to allow the saffron time to infuse the stock. Strain the shrimp stock and reserve.
            

              For the fideos: Set a paella pan over medium heat and coat with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and all of the butter. Add the vermicelli and toast stirring regularly until light golden brown about 5 minutes; do not walk away during this step as the noodles can burn easily. Transfer the noodles to a bowl.
            

              Coat the paella pan again with another 2 tablespoons of the olive oil add the chorizo and cook until the spices from the sausage begin to color the oil. Add the onions and cook until softened and aromatic about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more. Add the smoked paprika and red pepper flakes and season with salt. Add the wine and cook until reduced by half. Add the tomatoes and cook until almost all of the liquid has evaporated 5 to 6 minutes.
            

              Set an oven rack in the middle position and preheat the broiler.
            

              Add the toasted vermicelli the reserved shrimp stock and the chicken stock; it should come to 4 cups total liquid. Lower the heat to medium and cook until all liquid has been absorbed 15 to 20 minutes stirring every few minutes.
            

              Season the shrimp with salt and toss with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. When the noodles are cooked but still have a little al dente bite to them stir in the asparagus then arrange the shrimp and mussels on top of the noodles. Transfer the paella pan to the oven and broil until the top is golden brown and crispy 8 to 10 minutes; rotate the pan halfway through for even browning. Watch closely during broiling to prevent burning. You'll know the paella is ready when the top of the spaghetti is nicely browned the shrimp are bright pink and the mussels have popped open. Garnish with the parsley and serve with lemon wedges and smoked paprika aioli.

              Preheat a flattop griddle or barbeque grill to medium heat. Cook the Pastrami Dogs on the griddle or grill until the skin becomes very taught and slightly charred without splitting. If the juice spills out so does the fun.
            

              Spread the salted butter on each side of the Rye Split Top Hot Dog Buns evenly.
            

              Split the buns slightly keeping the bottom intact. Divide the gruyere evenly inside the bun. Try to keep the gruyere on both sides; this is easier to do with slices but you don't often find sliced gruyere. And gruyere is so so good.
            

              Grill both sides of the buns until you get that "grilled cheese" look: perfectly golden brown. Put the dogs in the buns. Top each dog with 1 tablespoon of the 1000 Island Dressing and the Celebration Slaw. Be blown away by the awesomeness that is the Reuben Dog.
            

Pastrami Dogs:


              Arrange the meat in a single layer on a plastic-lined sheet tray or in a re-sealable plastic bag. Place the meat in the freezer until the meat is partially but not totally frozen 30 to 45 minutes. I call this the semifreddo stage.
            

              Set a bowl within a larger bowl full of ice. Grind the meat through the largest grinding plate of the meat grinder into the non-ice bowl.
            

              Combine the ground meat with the ice water kosher salt dextrose pickling spice brown sugar and pink salt. Place the meat mixture in a re-sealable plastic bag and cure for 24 to 48 hours.
            

              Spread the meat onto a plastic-lined sheet pan. Place the meat in the freezer until the mixture is very stiff (semifreddo again) about 30 minutes.
            

              Set a bowl within a larger bowl full of ice. Grind the meat mixture and garlic together using the smallest plate of a meat grinder into the non-ice bowl.
            

              Mix the meat in the bowl of a stand mixer with a chilled paddle attachment until the mixture looks like stiff dough several minutes. The temperature of the meat should be below 35 degrees F at this point.
            

              Add the coriander peppercorns and juniper berries. Add the milk powder and mix about 2 minutes. Add the liquid smoke if poaching not smoking the dogs.
            

              Boil a small pot of water to 200 degrees F. Test the meat: create a small meatball wrapped in plastic wrap. Boil the meatball until it reaches 140 degrees F internally about 10 minutes. Taste the meatball to see if more seasoning is needed. The texture should be firm and springy like a good hot dog. If the meatball is crumbly you may need to start over. Sorry.
            

              Return the meat to a re-sealable plastic bag and refrigerate until stuffing time or begin stuffing straight away. Stuff the meat into the hog casings and create links by tying off the casings with the butcher's twine.
            

              Preheat a smoker or charcoal grill with a cover between 180 to 200 degrees F. Smoke the links in the smoker or grill until they reach an internal temperature of 150 degrees F 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
            

              If smoking on a grill place the links on one side of the grill and place approximately twenty pieces of charcoal on the other side of the grill. The grill is ready to smoke when the lit charcoal is no longer ablaze. Monitor your grill carefully. If the internal temperature of the grill or smoker gets too high the links will cook too quickly.
            

              Alternatively the links can be poached in 200 degrees F water until the internal temperature of the links are 150 degrees F.
            

              Transfer the links to an ice bath and chill until the internal temperature is about 100 degrees F.
            

Rye Split Top Hot Dog Buns:


              Combine the rye flour milk onion honey unsalted butter and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer using the dough hook. Allow to rest 5 to 10 minutes. The mixture may not bubble much but it should start to swell slightly.
            

              Add 2 1/2 cups of the bread flour the water and caraway seeds. Mix slowly at first and then on medium speed. Add 1/2 cup more of the bread flour and the salt. The dough should come together and have a tacky but not too sticky consistency. Add more of the bread flour as needed to get the dough where it just pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Continue mixing until the dough looks smooth about 5 minutes.
            

              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Turn the oven off 3 minutes after reaching the temperature. Spray the inside of a bowl with nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the turned-off oven. Allow the dough to rise until doubled in bulk about 1 hour.
            

              After the dough rises remove the bowl from the oven.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              Punch the dough and transfer to a work space. Separate the dough into 13 pieces about 3 ounces each using a bench knife. Use both your hands to roll the dough into tight uniform balls. Make sure there are no air pockets in the middle of your dough balls.
            

              Roll each ball into 7-inch cylinders using both hands and rolling from the middle out. Make sure the cylinders are even in length or your buns will be wonky. Keep whatever dough you are not immediately working with covered loosely with plastic.
            

              Line a 15-inch-long or longer sheet pan with parchment paper or cover well in nonstick spray. Place each dough cylinder side-by-side up the center of the sheet pan leaving 1/2-inch space between each one. Cover the pan with plastic and allow to rise until the cylinders are touching about 15 minutes.
            

              Remove the plastic wrap. Combine 1 tablespoon water with the egg white and brush this mixture in an even coat all over the dough. Allow the dough to rise about 15 minutes.
            

              Bake the dough until the buns are nicely golden brown on top and 190 degrees F in the center rotating the pan halfway through the baking time about 20 minutes total. Allow the buns to rest in the pan 10 to 15 minutes.
            

              Transfer the buns in one piece (that's very important) to a cooling rack to prevent soggy-bottom buns and cool about 30 minutes.
            

              Transfer the buns to a cutting surface. Slice down the center of each tube of dough using a serrated knife (this is the cool part). You will lose half a tube on each end hence yielding only 12 buns and 2 awesome slices of rye bread that you will eat immediately. The place where the tubes meet is now the center of the bun. They should split naturally but you can use a serrated knife to help them if you choose.
            

              Now you have a beautiful bread wall that you can butter and toast. Wrap the buns in plastic or a re-sealable plastic bag until ready to use. Freeze the buns immediately if you will not be using them the same day.
            

1000 Island Dressing:


              Combine the Garlic Mayo pickles ketchup chili sauce Worcestershire lemon juice and sprinkle with salt. Mix until a homogenous consistency is reached.
            

Garlic Mayo:


              Combine the lemon juice mustard salt garlic and egg yolks in a blender or food processor. Blend on medium speed until the mixture is smooth. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil until emulsified. You will hear a "slapping" sound from the blender or food processor when the oil starts to emulsify. Blend the mixture until all of the oil is incorporated; the consistency should be that of a heavy mayonnaise. Use the mayo immediately or refrigerate and keep for up to a month.
            

              This recipe can also be made by combining 1 cup store-bought mayo 1 clove crushed garlic and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.
            

Celebration Slaw:


              Combine the Garlic Mayo Creole mustard light brown sugar apple cider vinegar lemon juice scallion buttermilk salt hot sauce black pepper and jalapenos in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk the ingredients until incorporated. Set aside. Any of this mixture that you do not used can be stored in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks.
            

              Toss the coleslaw jalapenos and Garlic Mayo mixture to desired creaminess in a large mixing bowl about 6 tablespoons Garlic Mayo mixture to 4 cups coleslaw. Serve immediately.

Profiteroles with Hazelnut Mascarpone Recipe | Anne Burrell | Food Network, 1/2 cup water 4 tablespoons unsalted butter Pinch salt 1/2 cup all-purpose flour Pinch ground cinnamon 2 large eggs 2 cups heavy cream very cold 2 cups mascarpone room temperature 1/2 cup praline paste Chocolate Sauce to serve recipe follows 1/4 cup hazelnuts toasted and chopped for garnish 4 ounces semisweet or dark chocolate 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon corn syrup 1 good pinch ground cinnamon ,               Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Put a large bowl in the freezer to whip the cream.
            

              In a small saucepan over medium heat combine the water butter and salt and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat add the flour and cinnamon all at once stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon. Cook until the mixture forms a ball has a slightly sweaty sheen to it and has pulled away from the sides of the pan. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and let it cool for 3 to 4 minutes. It does not have to be cold just cool enough so the eggs don't cook when you add them. Using an electric mixer or lots of good old fashioned elbow grease beat in the eggs 1 at a time. Do not add the second egg until the first is fully incorporated.
            

              Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag equipped with a large straight tip and pipe 1-inch balls onto a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. Be sure to leave at least 1-inch between each of the balls they grow! When done dip your finger in water and smooth the top of each ball where the pastry tip was removed. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes rotating the tray halfway through the cooking time to insure even browning. The puffs should be light airy and dry inside. Cool on a rack.
            

              Put the heavy cream into the cold bowl and whip it to stiff peaks with a head mixer. Put the mascarpone in a large bowl and gently mix in the praline paste. When the praline paste is combined begin to fold in the whipped cream. When the whipped cream is fully incorporated spoon the mixture into a clean pastry bag. Cut the tops off each profiterole and fill with the mascarpone mixture. Replace the tops and drizzle with the warm chocolate sauce. Transfer to a large serving platter and garnish with chopped hazelnuts.
            

Chocolate Sauce:


              Fill a medium saucepan with 2-inches of water and put it over medium heat. In a bowl large enough to sit on the saucepan without the bottom touching the water add the chocolate cream butter corn syrup and cinnamon. Stir until the chocolate has melted and everything is combined. This is a pretty quick process. When the chocolate is melted remove it from the heat and spoon it over the filled profiteroles. This is best served warm!

Sweet Potato Layer Cake with Spiced Pecan Buttercream Recipe | Food Network, 2 1/2 cups pecan halves 1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon 2 teaspoons ground nutmeg 5 tablespoons unsalted butter melted 2 tablespoons dark rum 2 pounds sweet potatoes 4 large eggs 2 cups sugar 1 cup canola oil 2 cups cake flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 teaspoon ground ginger 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons rum 1 1/4 cups chopped Spiced Pecans 6 large egg yolks 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup light corn syrup 1 pound unsalted butter room temperature 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1/8 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup Spiced Pecans 1/2 cup chopped Spiced Pecans ,               Make Spiced Pecans: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              Place the pecans in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast them for 10 minutes until fragrant. Meanwhile combine the brown sugar cinnamon and nutmeg in a medium bowl using your fingers to mix everything thoroughly. Stir in the melted butter to make a paste. Add the toasted pecans to the mixture and stir to coat then spread them evenly on the baking sheet and return to the oven for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven drizzle over the rum and bake for 8 more minutes stirring once. Remove from the oven cool completely and leave the oven on. When cool chop the pecans into medium-fine pieces some larger than others and set aside.
            

              Meanwhile pierce the sweet potatoes with a fork. Microwave on high until very tender about 8 minutes per side. Cool peel and mash the sweet potatoes with a potato masher or fork.
            

              Lower oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Spray 2 (8-inch) round cake pans with nonstick baking spray and set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat the eggs and sugar together on medium speed until light and fluffy 4 minutes. Add the canola oil; beat on medium until combined. Add the mashed sweet potatoes and mix until combined. Sift together cake flour baking powder salt cinnamon nutmeg and ginger and then mix the dry ingredients into the sweet potato mixture. Mix in vanilla and rum. Fold in 1 1/4 cups of the chopped Spiced Pecans by hand. Evenly distribute cake batter into the prepared pans and transfer to the oven. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean 40 to 45 minutes. Let pans cool on a wire rack 10 minutes. Invert cakes onto rack; cool completely.
            

              Make the buttercream while the cake is baking: Beat the egg yolks in the clean bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high until very thick about 5 minutes. Combine the sugar with the syrup in a small saucepan and set over medium-high heat stirring constantly until the mixture comes to a full boil. Immediately scrape the mixture into a heatproof 1-cup glass measure. With the mixer on high speed pour a few tablespoons of the sugar mixture into the yolks and beat for a few seconds. Repeat until all of the syrup has been added. Beat until the bowl has cooled to room temperature. On medium speed add the butter 2 tablespoons at a time beating well after each addition. The frosting will begin to come together after all of the butter has been incorporated (it will look curdled first but be patient and it will come together beautifully!). Scrape the bowl and beat in the vanilla and salt. Mix in 3/4 cup chopped Spiced Pecans.
            

              Cut each cooled cake layer in half horizontally creating 4 layers. Set 1 layer cut side up on a cake round or cake plate and spread a thin layer of frosting on the surface. Stack next layer on top and frost. Repeat frosting-and-stacking process until each layer is frosted. Spread remaining frosting on sides and top of cake. Arrange remaining Spiced Pecans decoratively on top of cake. Chill for 1 hour or serve immediately if you can't wait!

              Make the molds: Place the Elastack molding material in a saucepan over medium heat until melted. Use metal rulers to outline the mold that you would like to make. For my centerpiece I used some ceramic art souvenirs I bought in Mexico. Place the rulers on a parchment paper lined sheet pan and place the item to be molded in the center of that space. Pour the melted Elastack over the item to be molded until it is completely covered. Let this set for about 30 minutes until the Elastack hardens. When set remove the original piece. Now the mold is ready to use. Make the cocoa pods: Use a ladle to fill the cocoa pod mold with white chocolate. When it is full empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden about 5 minutes scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat with as many cocoa pods as you would like. If you are using the cocoa pod as a container to hold something do not glue the 2 halves together. Otherwise use tempered chocolate to glue the 2 halves together. If you want to paint the cocoa pods there are 2 methods. The first is to mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a paintbrush to paint the inside of the mold applying color where you are inspired to do so. Then follow the instructions that follow to make a mold. The second method is to use an airbrush. If you use an airbrush simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and decorate as you are inspired.
            

              Make the mask: Use a ladle to fill the cocoa pod mold with chocolate. When it is full empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden about 5 minutes scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. Give the mold another coat so it will be especially strong. Follow the same procedures. When the chocolate sets it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat with as many masks as you would like. Use the paintbrush techniques described above to paint the mask. Then use the airbrush to spray color over the face. If the airbrush splatters paint onto the chocolate surface blend it with a paintbrush. Make the base: Use flexible aluminum strips or large cake ring to form a base. The base I made was 10-inches in diameter. Place the ring on a parchment paper lined surface. Pour tempered chocolate inside the ring to form a 1-inch-thick layer. When the chocolate has set remove the ring and peel off the parchment paper.
            

              Make a support pole: Roll a piece of acetate into a tube that is 22-inches long and 3-inches in diameter and tape it closed. Set the tube on end and fill with chocolate. When it is full invert the tube over the bowl of chocolate allowing the excess chocolate to flow back into the bowl. Let set. When the chocolate has set repeat this step a few more times. You want the tube to be quite sturdy as the rest of the centerpiece will depend on it. Allow the chocolate tube to set until hard. Remove the acetate. Use a hot knife to trim the base of the tube so it is flat. Then use the knife to scar the bottom. You want to make it somewhat textured so it will form a better seal to the base. Use tempered chocolate to glue the pole onto the base. Position it well so you can rest the molded chocolate against it. Repeat this procedure making another tube. Use a hot sharp chef's knife to cut the second tube into 2 equal pieces. A diagonal cut will be more pleasing to the eye in the finished presentation. To do this heat the knife under very hot water and wipe it dry. Hold the knife blade against the side of the chocolate where you want to make the cut. Do not press on the knife or the chocolate will break. Allow the heat of the knife to "cut" through the chocolate by melting it. Use tempered chocolate to glue the shorter pieces to the center pole. Then glue the center pole onto the base. Position it well so you can rest the molded chocolate against it.
            

              Use a paintbrush to paint the support poles with tempered chocolate. This will give the support pole the illusion that is made from wood. Use the newly made Elastack molds. Use a ladle to fill the mold cavity with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean with a sharp knife. Once the chocolate starts to harden about 5 minutes scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. To unmold invert the mold and peel the mold from the chocolate. Repeat to make more chocolate molds of the pieces in your design. I painted 1 of the ceramic pieces with a mixture of vegetable oil and powdered food colors. Then I used a towel to wipe a bit of the color off to make the painting look antique. Use tempered chocolate to adhere the chocolate pieces to the support pole. If you are using the cocoa pod as a container to hold the cookies place cookies inside the bottom and rest the other 1/2 of the pod on top. You can also tie a pod closed with a ribbon to make a unique gift.

Creamy Rice Pudding with the Quickest Strawberry Jam Recipe | Jamie Oliver | Food Network, 2 pounds strawberries hulled washed and drained 1/2 cup sugar 5 cups organic whole milk 7 ounces medium-grain rice 2 tablespoons vanilla sugar 2 ounces store-bought meringues crumbled Optional: a few wild strawberries to serve ,               Rice pudding is loved by everyone and it's one of my favorite desserts. Proper feel-good food it's gorgeous served on its own or with whatever fruit you've got knocking around. For me though the best way of eating it especially in the summer is really cold with hot strawberry jam. As an alternative you can broil or roast peaches and plums to serve with it. Beautiful!
            

              I used to make jam with my mum when I was a kid. For a lovely fresh strawberry taste I now use less sugar and I don't cook it for quite as long as my mum used to. Any leftover jam will keep in the fridge for a couple of weeks if you store it in a jar rinsed with boiling water but you'll probably find it gets eaten way before that! It's great served as a sauce alongside a tart drizzled over ice cream or simply spread on a piece of toast or fresh bread.
            

For the rice pudding:


              Place the strawberries in a wide stainless steel pan and sprinkle the sugar over the top. Scrunch the strawberries up with your hands really pushing them between your fingers to pulp them up - the mixture will start to look like jam at this point. You want all the sugar to dissolve in the strawberry juice before you put the pan on the heat and bring it to the boil. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes on a medium heat and every 5 minutes or so come back to your jam to skim off the foam. Don't worry if it's still a bit liquid - it needs to be so you can swirl it into your rice pudding. Remove the pan from the heat and put aside. There you have it - beautiful quintessential strawberry jam!
            

              Meanwhile place the milk rice and vanilla sugar in a deep saucepan. Bring to a medium simmer and put on the lid. Cook for half an hour stirring occasionally until the rice pudding is thick creamy oozy and moist. If it ends up being a bit too thick you can thin it down by adding a little more milk.
            

              To serve divide the rice pudding between your bowls. Spoon over a big dollop of your beautiful strawberry jam then slowly swirl it in so it marbles and ripples through the rice pudding. Sprinkle over the meringue pieces and scatter with a few wild strawberries if you like.

Clam, Chorizo and Kale Parchment Pack Recipe | Food Network Kitchen | Food Network, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 clove garlic finely grated 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 5 ounces curly kale stems removed leaves thinly sliced (about 3 tightly-packed cups) One 15-ounce can no-salt cannellini beans drained and rinsed 1 ounce Spanish-style chorizo papery skin peeled sliced into thin half-moons (about 1/4 cup) 32 littleneck clams scrubbed 1/4 cup dry sherry or dry white wine 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves for serving , Special equipment: parchment paper

              Position 2 racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Combine the olive oil garlic and smoked paprika in a small bowl and set aside.
            

              Cut four 16-inch long sheets of parchment paper. Fold each sheet in half and open it like a book. Divide the pieces of parchment between 2 baking sheets (2 pieces per sheet).
            

              Divide the kale beans and chorizo between the four parchment sheets placing ingredients on one side of the fold. Drizzle with the sherry and garlic-paprika oil. Top each serving with a single layer of 8 clams.
            

              Fold over the top half of the parchment crimping and overlapping small folds along the open edge to seal tightly leaving enough room for the clams to open up. Bake until the parchment puffs and the clams open 15 to 20 minutes. (To tell if the clams are open gently press the top of the puffed pack with a large spoon and feel the shells; if they give and are springy they are open.)
            

              Carefully slide each pack off the tray and into individual serving bowls. Taking care to avoid the hot steam cut open one end of the pack and let the contents slide into the bowl. Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.

Grilled Mahi-Mahi with Black Bean Salsa Recipe | Ingrid Hoffmann | Food Network, 1/2 cup soy sauce 1/2 cup orange juice 1/4 cup ketchup 1 tablespoon honey 2 tablespoons lime juice (from about 1 lime) 1 garlic clove finely minced 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh basil leaves 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh oregano leaves Freshly ground black pepper 4 (7 to 8-ounce) mahi-mahi steaks about 1-inch thick Canola or vegetable oil for greasing the grill grates 2 cups cherry tomatoes halved 2 scallions white and light green parts only thinly sliced 1 (14-ounce) can black beans drained and rinsed 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves 1 jalapeno finely chopped (seeded and ribbed for less heat) 2 tablespoons lime juice (from about 1 lime) Salt , Watch how to make this recipe.


              Place the soy sauce orange juice ketchup honey lime juice garlic basil oregano and pepper in a small bowl and whisk until the honey is completely dissolved. Pour the marinade into a re-sealable plastic bag with the fish fillets and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 to 45 minutes.
            

              Toss the tomatoes scallions black beans cilantro jalapeno and the lime juice in a medium bowl. Add some salt to taste and set aside to let the flavors develop.
            

              Oil your grill grates with canola oil to help prevent sticking. If using a gas grill preheat the grill to high. Grill the fish for 5 to 6 minutes on a side turning carefully using a turner large enough to support the entire piece of fish until browned firm and flaky. Serve with the black bean salsa and lime wedges.
            

              Indoor Variation: To cook on a grill pan on the stovetop heat the grill pan over high heat. Remove the fish from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Brush both sides of the fish with oil and place on the hot grill pan. Oiling the fish instead of the pan will limit the amount of smoke. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes on each side.

Tequila BBQ Spare Ribs Recipe | Guy Fieri | Food Network, Two 4-pound slabs pork spare ribs St. Louis style-cut 2 tablespoons ground cumin 2 tablespoons granulated garlic 2 tablespoons onion powder 2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons ground black pepper 1 teaspoon ancho chile powder Tequila BBQ sauce for serving recipe follows 1 small California/New Mexico dried chile One 6-ounce can tomato paste 1 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup white tequila 1/4 cup lime juice 1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic 1 tablespoon molasses Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper ,               Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.
            

              Begin by trimming the ribs of any excess fat or sinew. Remove the thin membrane from the back side of the ribs and discard. Make the rub by combining the cumin garlic onion powder paprika salt pepper and ancho chile powder together in a mixing bowl.
            

              Set a few large sheets of foil out (one set for each slab). Place 1 rack on each sheet and divide the dry rub between each slab. Rub the mixture into the ribs on both sides and then fold the foil over to form a sealed pouch around each rack. At this stage make sure the racks are meat-side down. Place each pouch on a roasting tray and bake in the oven for 2 hours. After 2 hours open up the foil and peel back so the ribs are exposed. Carefully turn the meat over so the meat side is on top and then cook for 1 1/2 more hours with the open foil. When done the ribs will be tender and the meat will have shrunk back from the bones. Finish under the broiler to add more color 1 to 2 minutes.
            

              Serve the ribs with Tequila BBQ Sauce.

              To prepare the patties sprinkle the ground beef with 1 tablespoon salt and 1 tablespoon pepper. Mix well. Divide the beef into 4 burgers to create 5-inch-wide even burgers. Do not over mix or squish because this will cause the burgers to be tough.
            

              To cook the burgers ladle the bacon fat on a hot flat top grill or in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Once the bacon fat is hot add the burgers and cook for 4 minutes on the first side and then flip and repeat the cooking. This should yield a medium burger. For higher cook temperature finish in a 400 degree F oven to desired temperature. Once cooked to desired temperature top with the BBQ pork and a slice of cheese. Allow to melt for 1 minute.
            

              During this time spread the butter on the buns. Then place the buttered side on the flat top or in the pan to brown the butter; this will create "sealed" bread to build the burger on.
            

              Begin assembling the burger. Take the buns off the grill and place 1/4 cup slaw on each cooked bottom bun then a tomato slice 2 red onions and the burger patty. Finish with the top bun. A skewer can be placed to hold the burger together.

Sharsh's White Bean Chicken Chili Recipe | Food Network, 8 to 9 poblano peppers roasted peeled and chopped 3 medium onions 1 yellow bell pepper 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 cloves garlic pressed 1 teaspoon chili powder 1 teaspoon ancho chili powder 5 boneless skinless chicken breasts diced 12 to 15 tomatillos washed paper-like skins removed 1 quart chicken broth Jalapeno or serrano peppers if needed for spice (poblanos will vary in their heat) Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 (15-ounce) cans white beans rinsed drained 1/2 cup chopped cilantro leaves plus more for garnish Lime slices for garnish ,               Roast the poblano peppers on a grill or under the broiler turning often until blackened and soft. Place them in a bowl covered with plastic wrap to cool (this will make peeling them easier). When cool; peel seed and dice the poblano peppers.
            

              Dice the onions and bell pepper. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or kettle. Add onions yellow bell pepper poblano peppers pressed garlic chili powder and ancho chili powder. Saute this mixture until the onions are tender 5 to 7 minutes. Add the diced chicken breast and continue to cook until chicken is fully cooked 10 to 15 minutes depending on the size of your dice.
            

              Wash and stem the tomatillos then run them through a food processor until they are pulverized but still have some texture (you could dice them by hand but this will leave the tomatillo skins floating around in your finished product). Add the tomatillos and the broth to the chicken and pepper mixture. After this is heated through (about 10 minutes) check the spiciness and if necessary add either a finely chopped jalapeno or serrano pepper for more heat (we're looking for a slow sustained burn not fire). Season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer for 30 minutes to meld the flavors. Add the beans and cilantro cook a final 5 minutes to heat thoroughly and serve with a garnish of cilantro and lime slice.

Upside-Down Pear Cranberry Tart Recipe | Food Network Kitchen | Food Network, 2 1/2 pounds (about 5) hard Anjou or Bosc pears peeled cored and quartered 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg Juice from 1 lemon (2 to 3 tablespoons) 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 teaspoon salt 2/3 cups granulated sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup dried cranberries 2 tablespoons finely chopped crystalized ginger All-purpose flour for dusting 1 Pie Crust recipe follows or 2 refrigerated store-bought crusts rolled together Creme fraiche for serving optional 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon salt 1 stick cold butter cut into 1/2-inch chunks 4 to 5 tablespoons ice water ,               Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Toss the pears nutmeg and half of the lemon juice together in a bowl.
            

              Melt the butter with the remaining lemon juice the salt and 3 tablespoons water in a heavy ovenproof 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the sugar into the skillet and stir to combine. Cook the mixture without stirring letting it foam and bubble; the butter will separate which is OK. Watch the mixture carefully while it cooks because once the water evaporates and the sugar begins to change color things happen quickly. When it becomes the color of light brown sugar about 10 minutes remove it from the heat. Stir in the vanilla.
            

              Being careful not to burn yourself sprinkle the cranberries and ginger into the caramel. Arrange the pears in the skillet round side-down in concentric circles as nicely as you can fitting in as many pears as possible.
            

              Return the skillet to the burner over medium heat and cook until the pears start to soften when you poke them with a knife 10 to 15 minutes.
            

              While your pears cook roll out your Pie Crust on a flour-dusted surface to an 11-inch circle. Cover the crust with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.
            

              Lay the crust over the pears tucking it in around the edge of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Bake until the crust is golden brown and firm to the touch about 30 minutes.
            

              Allow the tart to cool until you can handle it about 10 minutes. Put a plate on top of the tart using heatproof pads and flip it over so the pears are on top. Slice and serve warm with creme fraiche if using.
            

Pie Crust:


              Combine the flour sugar salt and butter in a food processor and pulse until the butter is evenly distributed but still visible in chunks. While pulsing add the ice water 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough is just wet enough to hold together when pinched between your fingers. Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap form into a disc and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.

White Chocolate Holiday Bark Recipe | Food Network Kitchen | Food Network, 1 pound finely chopped white chocolate 1 1/2 teaspoons nut or plain oil 1/2 cup dried cranberries 1 1/4 cups shelled pistachio nuts toasted and papery coating peeled , Special equipment: Chocolate thermometer

              Tempering the chocolate for the bark requires a double boiler. If you don't have a double boiler improvise one by using a saucepan and a stainless steel bowl: Nestle the bowl into the saucepan allowing a few inches of space to remain between the bottom of the bowl and the bottom of the saucepan. Keep an extra bowl of a similar size on hand to transfer the chocolate for cooling. Rest the chocolate thermometer on a towel. Line a baking sheet with foil.
            

              Pour a couple inches of water into the bottom half of the double boiler and heat over medium-low to just below a simmer. Put the chocolate in the top half of the double boiler and set over the hot water. Slowly melt the chocolate stirring with a heat-resistant rubber spatula. As the chocolate melts check the temperature periodically to make sure it stays between 82 and 86 degrees F. If it starts to rise above this temperature quickly transfer the chocolate to the bowl on reserve and stir briskly to reduce heat. Return bowl to double boiler to maintain heat between 82 and 86 degrees F.
            

              Remove bowl from over the hot water just before all the chocolate melts. Stir vigorously until the chocolate melts completely. Check temperature again. Stir in the oil until evenly blended. Chocolate is now tempered and ready to use. Keep within the 82 to 86 degree F range returning bowl briefly to the double boiler if necessary.
            

              Quickly stir the fruit and nuts into the chocolate. Spread chocolate mixture out on the prepared baking sheet so it's about 1/2-inch thick and the fruit and nuts are coated. Set bark aside at room temperature to harden. Break into angled pieces. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.

Individual Chocolate Indulgence Cake Recipe | Food Network, 1 cup bittersweet chocolate 6 tablespoons butter unsalted 1/4 cups sugar 2 eggs 1/4 cup all-purpose flour Fresh raspberries Raspberry sauce Chocolate sauce recipe follows 1 cup whole milk 10 1/2 ounces bittersweet chocolate chopped 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/3 cup sugar ,               Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
            

              In the top of a double boiler melt the chocolate then add the butter and sugar until just melted. Add eggs and whisk until well combined; add flour and mix only until combined. Do not overmix or the cake will be rubbery. Lightly grease four 4-ounce disposable aluminum cups muffin molds or ramekins with vegetable baking spray. Distribute batter among the four molds. Place molds on a sheet pan and bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Do not overbake.
            

              For the Chocolate Sauce: Pour the milk into a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. When it boils remove the milk from the heat and make a ganache by adding the chopped chocolate. Whisk well stirring into the edge of the saucepan to combine. The ganache should be homogenous and smooth. Set the ganache aside.
            

              In a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan combine the heavy cream butter and sugar. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil stirring occasionally. The butter should be completely melted and the sugar completely dissolved. Once the mixture has come to a boil pour it into the warm ganache. Place the sauce over medium-high heat and bring to a boil stirring constantly with a whisk. As the chocolate sauce cooks it will begin to thicken slightly. When it reaches a boil remove it from the heat and pour it into a clean dry bowl. Cover by placing plastic wrap directly on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming. Let the chocolate sauce cool to room temperature before storing in the refrigerator. When cold the sauce will become thick enough to be scooped with a spoon.
            

              Invert molds onto individual serving plates. If you would like to decorate the plate do so with fresh raspberries or fruit or chocolate sauce and serve immediately.
            

              The sauce can be reheated whenever needed. If using a microwave simply place the chocolate sauce in a microwaveable bowl and heat it at medium-high power in 30-second intervals until it becomes liquid. On the stovetop place in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat and stir occasionally until it becomes liquid. If you store it in a squeeze bottle you can easily drizzle it over a dessert or decorate a plate. It will keep in the refrigerator for up to three weeks. It can also be frozen for up to two months if stored in an airtight container. Thaw in the refrigerator and heat as described above until liquid.

Deep Chocolate Pudding Recipe | Food Network, 1 cup granulated sugar 4 tablespoon cornstarch 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 1/8 teaspoon salt 2 1/2 cups whole milk or substitute 2 percent milk 4 large egg yolks 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 4 ounces good-quality bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chopped Lightly sweetened whipped cream to serve if desired ,               Place sugar in a large bowl. Sift over it the cornstarch cocoa and salt. Add 1/2 cup of the milk and stir the mixture to make a thick paste. Lightly beat the egg yolks then add these to the cornstarch mixture whisking to blend well. Wrap a damp towel around the base of the bowl to prevent it from sliding around when the scalded milk is added.
            

              Meanwhile in a heavy-bottomed 2-quart saucepan combine the remaining 2 cups milk and the cream. Bring these just to the boil then remove the pot from the heat. Pour a small amount of the hot liquid into the cornstarch-cocoa mixture whisking constantly. Continue to whisk the milk-cream mixture into the bowl gradually until all of the liquid has been incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Rinse out the pot used to scald the milk and the cream but don't dry it: this will help prevent the pudding from scorching on the bottom. Pour the custard into the clean pot and add the vanilla.
            

              Have ready a clean mesh sieve over a medium sized bowl. Return the pot to the stove and stir with a wooden spoon over low to medium-low heat until the custard thickens about 5 to 7 minutes. It should approach but never quite reach a boil and be about the consistency of mayonnaise when it's done. This custard behaves strangely you may fear something has gone terribly wrong but press on! It will get increasingly lumpy to the point where just as it reaches the right thickness it will seem downright chunky: never mind! Quickly remove the pot from the element and pour through the sieve into the clean bowl pressing the custard through with a rubber spatula.
            

              Add the finely chopped or grated chocolate in 2 additions stirring gently with a clean wooden spoon or rubber spatula until the chocolate is melted smoothly into the pudding. Spoon the pudding into 6 to 8 serving dishes or goblets and chill at least 6 hours or overnight. If you like the pudding with no skin on the top press plastic wrap onto the surface of the warm pudding in the serving dishes. If a skin on your chocolate pudding makes you happily nostalgic wait until the puddings are cold before covering. The pudding can be made up to 2 days ahead of time.
            

              Serve just as it is or with a dollop of lightly sweetened whipped cream for a truly decadent dessert.

Chocolate Genoise Recipe | Food Network, 8 large eggs 3 large egg yolks 1 cup (7 ounces 200 grams) granulated sugar 2 1/2 (1.7 ounces 50 grams) tablespoons honey 2 cups (8.8 ounces 250 grams) unbleached unbromated pastry flour sifted 1/3 cup cocoa powder (if making chocolate genoise) ,               Place a 1-quart saucepan half filled with water over high heat and bring it to a simmer. Make a double boiler by setting a large mixing bowl over the simmering water. Place the whole eggs egg yolks sugar and honey in the mixing bowl and make an egg foam by whisking the mixture to 113 degrees F (45 degrees C) on a candy thermometer about 7 to 10 minutes. The egg foam passes through various stages becoming foamy then smooth and finally it thickens. When it is thick it will be hot to the touch tripled in volume and light in color and the sugar will have completely dissolved. If you dip the whisk into the mixture and pull it out the batter should fall back into the bowl in a thick ribbon.
            

              Remove the mixing bowl from the heat and whip the batter with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until it cools increases in volume stiffens slightly and becomes pale yellow about 7 to 10 minutes. Take the time to whip it well; if the mixture is underwhipped the baked genoise will be dense. Very very carefully fold in the flour with a rubber spatula until the flour is no longer visible making sure to fold to the bottom of the bowl. Do not overmix or the batter will deflate.
            

              I bake the genoise on a baking sheet 99 percent of the time because then I can cut it to any size I want. Spread the batter over a parchment paper-covered baking sheet and bake in a preheated 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) oven until lightly and evenly browned and springy to the touch about 10 minutes. If using cake pans fill buttered and parchment paper-lined 8-inch round cake pans three quarters full. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until well-risen and golden brown about 30 minutes. Genoise is baked at a higher temperature for a shorter period of time on a baking sheet than when baked in a cake pan to allow it to retain moisture; if overbaked it will be dry and crunchy.
            

              Let the genoise cool slightly. Unmold and finish cooling on a wire rack to allow the air to circulate evenly around the cake. The baked genoise can be stored in the freezer for 2 to 3 weeks if well wrapped in plastic wrap. Return it to room temperature before using it.
            

              VARIATION: You can easily make this recipe into a Chocolate Genoise by substituting unsweetened cocoa powder for 10 to 20 percent of the weight (a scant 1/4 cup to a full 1/3 cup/0.8 to 1.6 ounces/25 to 50 grams) of the flour. Weigh the cocoa powder before you sift it.
            

              SIDEBAR: Genoise can be made with butter. In this recipe you can substitute butter (5 1/2 tablespoons 2.7 ounces or 75 grams) for the 3 large egg yolks. Melt and cool the butter and fold it in after the flour is added.

              Put the dough in a large bowl cover with a towel and allow it to rest in a warm place until it has doubled in size about 2 hours. If you are making the dough a day before put the bowl in the refrigerator and let rise slowly overnight.
            

              To cook the doughboys preheat a deep-fryer or heavy-bottomed pot with enough oil to come halfway up the sides of the pot to 375 degrees F.
            

              Be sure to use a frying thermometer to be accurate. Pull the dough into odd shapes that look like elephant ears then drop them into the fryer in batches and cook until golden brown about 3 minutes. Flip them over with a chop stick and cook the other side until golden brown a few more minutes. Repeat the process until all of the dough is used. Arrange them on a serving platter and serve with jam maple syrup and powdered sugar. Sit down get coffee and eat.
            

              Cook's Note: The dough usually made a day before using.

Potato Gnocchi with Heirloom Baby Tomato Sauce Recipe | Scott Conant | Food Network, 1 2/3 pounds Idaho potatoes Kosher salt 1 1/2 large egg yolks 1 1/3 cups 00 flour plus extra to work with the dough Kosher salt Heirloom Baby Tomato Sauce recipe follows Red pepper flakes to taste Extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling 2 tablespoons butter Finely grated Parmesan to taste Fresh basil leaves 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon thinly sliced garlic 1 quart small heirloom tomatoes or red cherry tomatoes halved Kosher salt 1 tablespoon thinly sliced fresh basil leaves (chiffonade) 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano Red pepper flakes to taste , Assembly:


              For the gnocchi: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the potatoes until cooked through 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
            

              Cut the potatoes in half scoop out the flesh and push the flesh through a tamis food mill or ricer. Spread the riced potato flesh on a clean work surface. Season with salt and allow it to release its steam for 2 minutes.
            

              In a small bowl whisk together the egg yolks and a generous pinch of salt.
            

              Sift the flour over the potatoes and mix gently with your hands lifting and letting the potatoes fall through your fingers. Drizzle the egg yolk mixture over the potatoes. Mix the dough and knead briefly until homogeneous. Roll into a log and cut into manageable pieces. Cover with a towel.
            

              One piece at a time roll until approximately 1/2 inch in diameter. Cut into individual pieces about 1 inch long. Shape the gnocchi using a fork or other pasta tool. Lay on a floured tray and reserve. Set aside 2 cups of the gnocchi for this recipe; use the remaining gnocchi immediately or freeze for later use (see Cook's Note).
            

              For the assembly: Fill a pot with water and season with salt; the water should taste like seasoned broth not salty like the sea. Bring the water to a boil.
            

              Add the gnocchi to the boiling water. When they rise to the surface cook for 1 to 2 more minutes.
            

              While the gnocchi are cooking add the Heirloom Baby Tomato Sauce to a saute pan with some red pepper flakes if using and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add 3 ounces of the pasta water to the saute pan then add the butter.
            

              Remove the gnocchi from the pot using a wire skimmer and add to the saute pan. (Note: You can also use a pasta basket or a perforated pan insert.) Toss the gnocchi in the pan to emulsify the butter and finish with some Parmesan and basil. Plate the gnocchi and finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.
            

Heirloom Baby Tomato Sauce:


              In a saute pan heat the oil slightly. Add the garlic slices and saute for 30 seconds; there should be no color on the garlic. Add the tomatoes to the pan season with a little salt and saute; the tomatoes will release their juices. Continue cooking until fairly dry. Add the basil and oregano and mix to incorporate. The sauce should be chunky fresh looking and not too thin. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and red pepper flakes if needed.

              In a blender or mini food processor combine the coconut poppy seeds curry leaves green chili and 1/2 cup water (or more) to make a paste like thick pesto. Set aside.
            

              Heat 3 tablespoons oil and 3 tablespoons ghee in a wide frying pan over medium-high heat. Add 3 cups onions and saute until the edges are lightly browned. Put in the garlic and ginger and continue frying about 3 minutes until you smell the aroma and the onions are brown. Stir in the ground masala garam masala salt and coconut paste and fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the yogurt lime juice cilantro and mint. Stir over medium-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Now put in the lamb pieces and stir. When the mixture comes to a boil reduce the heat cover and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes until the meat is tender. Stir occasionally.
            

              In a large bowl wash the rice in many changes of water until the water no longer appears cloudy. Drain thoroughly.
            

              Prepare the garnish by heating 2 tablespoons oil and 2 tablespoons ghee in a frying pan. Add the 2 cups onions and fry over medium-high heat stirring constantly until they turn deep reddish brown and crisp (10 to 15 minutes). Remove the onions to a plate with a slotted spoon. Fry the cashews in the reamining oil until brown. Remove the nuts with a slotted spoon and repeat with the raisins. Set aside.
            

              Prepare the rice by combining the 2 teaspoons salt the drained rice and 5 cups water in a large heavy pan with a tight-fitting lid. Bring to a boil cover and simmer 20 minutes on low heat. Remove from the heat.
            

              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              Fluff the rice and spread one third of it in the bottom of a casserole or Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid. Sprinkle one third of the fried onions cashews and raisins on top of rice then add half the lamb mixture. Continue to layer with one third of the rice one third of the garnish all the remaining lamb and finally the last third of rice. Reserve the last third of the garnish for later. Seal the top with foil then place the lid over the foil. Bake for 30 minutes.
            

              Spoon onto a large platter and garnish with the remaining fried onions cashews and raisins. Place the halved boiled eggs yolk up around the edges of the platter. Serve immediately.
            

Ghee:


              In a heavy preferably light-colored skillet melt the butter over medium-low heat. The melted butter will sputter gently as the moisture boils out of it and the bubbles will change from large to fine and foamy.
            

              Once the foam appears push it aside every few seconds to see if the milk solids have settled to the bottom of the pan. When this sediment appears golden brown remove it from the heat. Do not let it turn dark brown.
            

              Cool the ghee for a minute or two then pour the liquid into a container with a tight-fitting lid leaving most of the solids behind. Cool it completely cover and store at room temperature for 1 month or in the refrigerator for 3 months.
            

              Ghee turns to a solid as it cools so bring it to room temperature before using or melt it by placing the jar in which it is stored in hot water.
            

Garam Masala:


              Place the star anise in a coffee grinder and grind to a fine powder. Measure out 2 teaspoonfuls reserving the rest for another use.
            

              Grind the fennel seeds in the coffee grinder to form a fine powder.
            

              Combine all the ingredients and store in an airtight jar away from the light. It will keep for 6 months.

Spoon the bacon and onion mixture into each cup. Distribute the cheese evenly into the cups. Pour the egg mixture into each cup so that all of the quiches are the same size. Place into a preheated oven for 15 minutes or until the egg mixture is completely set.
            

Savory Crepes:


              In a blender combine all of the ingredients (excepting the butter for coating the pan) and pulse for 10 seconds. Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour. This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking. The batter will keep for up to 48 hours.
            

              Heat a small non-stick pan. Add butter to coat. Pour 1 ounce of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 30 seconds and flip. Cook for another 10 seconds and remove to the cutting board. Lay them out flat so they can cool. Continue until all batter is gone. After they have cooled you can stack them and store in sealable plastic bags in the refrigerator for several days or in the freezer for up to two months. When using frozen crepes thaw on a rack before gently peeling apart.

Neapolitan Ice Cream Recipe | Ree Drummond | Food Network, 6 cups half-and-half 4 cups sugar 1 vanilla bean 18 large egg yolks 6 cups heavy cream 6 ounces dark chocolate chips 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1/4 cup cocoa powder 1 pound strawberries hulled 2 tablespoons sugar 1 to 2 drops red food coloring , Watch how to make this recipe.

Special equipment: an ice cream maker

              For the custard base and vanilla ice cream layer: In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat combine the half-and-half and sugar. Stir it around to combine.
            

              Using a small paring knife split the vanilla bean down the middle. Scrape out the caviar inside and add it to the pan along with the bean. Stir the mixture around and heat it up until it's hot but not boiling.
            

              Add the egg yolks to a medium bowl and whisk them vigorously until the yolks are slightly lighter in color about 2 minutes.
            

              Remove the vanilla bean from the saucepan. Grab a ladle of the hot half-and-half mixture and drizzle it very slowly into the yolks whisking constantly. This will temper the egg yolks so that they don't scramble when they're added to the saucepan. Add another ladle of the hot liquid and when it's mixed in pour the egg mixture slowly into the half-and-half mixture stirring with a spoon until the mixture is thick and coating the spoon 2 minutes or so.
            

              Set a fine-mesh strainer over a clean glass bowl and strain the custard. Don't worry if it looks a little lumpy! That just means you're perfectly imperfect. Add the heavy cream to the bowl and stir to combine. Divide the mixture into three pitchers; set aside one pitcher to work with for the chocolate ice cream layer and chill the other two.
            

              For the chocolate ice cream layer: Melt the dark chocolate chips with the heavy cream over a double boiler. When the chocolate and cream mixture is smooth and melted add 1 cup of the reserved custard and combine. Return this mixture back to the pitcher. (This step is to ease the mixing process to make it easier to pour back into the custard and could therefore be omitted.) Whisk the cocoa into the pitcher. Pour into an ice cream maker and churn as per the manufacturer's instructions. (This will take approximately 1 hour.)
            

              Line two 6-cup loaf pans with plastic wrap. Scoop half of the chocolate ice cream into each. Smooth them over and place in the freezer for at least 1 hour.
            

              To make the vanilla ice-cream layer add the second pitcher of custard to the ice cream maker and churn according to the instructions. (Again approximately 1 hour.)
            

              Remove the loaf pans from the freezer and spread half of the vanilla ice cream in each. Smooth and return to the freezer for at least 1 hour.
            

              For the strawberry ice cream layer: Combine the strawberries sugar and red food coloring in a blender and puree until smooth (or you can stop just short of smooth if you want a little texture). Pour the pureed strawberries into the final third of the chilled custard mixtures and stir. Pour into the ice cream maker and churn.
            

              Remove the two pans from the freezer and scoop half of the strawberry ice cream into each making the final layer. Smooth and return to the freezer for at least an hour.
            

              To serve: Remove the loaf pans from the freezer turn them upside down onto a serving plate and remove the plastic wrap. Slice neatly with a knife that has been dipped in very hot water.

              To make the chocolate sauce: in a small saucepan bring the heavy cream to a boil. Place the chocolate pieces in a bowl and pour hot cream over the top. Whisk until the sauce is smooth.

Chocolate Cake Recipe | Food Network, 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour plus 1 tablespoon for dusting 3 cups granulated sugar 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon Dutch-process cocoa powder 1 tablespoon baking soda 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 eggs at room temperature 1 1/2 cups buttermilk at room temperature 1 1/2 cups strong black coffee hot 3/4 cup vegetable oil 4 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup evaporated milk 1 1/2 cups marshmallow fluff 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups salted peanuts roughly chopped 2 cups unsalted butter at room temperature 1/4 cup salted caramel sauce plus for drizzling optional 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 7 1/2 cups powdered sugar ,               For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease three 8-inch round cake pans and then flour the insides of the pans tapping out excess.
            

              In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large mixing bowl if you're using a hand mixer) sift together the flour sugar cocoa powder baking soda baking powder and salt. In a medium bowl whisk together the eggs buttermilk coffee oil and vanilla.
            

              Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix for 2 minutes on medium speed. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl; mix for an additional 20 seconds--the batter will be very thin. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans.
            

              Bake for 20 minutes. Rotate the pans and continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the cakes comes out almost clean with just a few moist crumbs about 12 minutes more. Cool the cakes in the pans on a wire racks for 20 minutes then carefully turn out onto cooling racks to cool completely.
            

              For the nougat filling: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the sugar and evaporated milk stirring until dissolved. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 minutes stirring occasionally. Remove the pan from the heat and add the marshmallow fluff peanut butter and vanilla extract stirring until completely smooth. Fold in the peanuts. Let the nougat mixture cool to room temperature stirring occasionally before using in the cake--you can do this by leaving it at room temperature or you can place it into the refrigerator to speed up the process. (Makes 2 cups.)
            

              For the salted-caramel buttercream frosting: In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat the butter on medium-high speed for 5 minutes. Pour in the salted caramel sauce salt and vanilla and beat until combined. Reduce the speed to medium-low and slowly add the powdered sugar a little at a time until fully incorporated. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy an additional 2 to 3 minutes. (Makes 2 cups.)

Baked Alaska Recipe | Food Network, 1 pound cake sponge cake or genoise baked in an 8-inch loaf pan About 1/2 gallon chocolate or coffee ice cream softened just enough so you can shape it 1/2 cup dry cherries or candied fruit optional 4 egg whites about 1/2 cup 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar Pinch salt ,               Cut a piece of cardboard the size of the cake. Wrap in aluminum foil. Set aside. Line the loaf pan with plastic wrap so it hangs well out over the edge. (The plastic wrap will be used to help lift the ice cream and cake loaf from the pan when it comes time to frost with meringue bake and serve.)
            

              Spoon the ice cream into the loaf pan. Scatter the dry cherries or candied fruit if you are using as you layer the ice cream into the loaf pan. Press down on the ice cream to make it as even as possible. Fill the pan about 3/4 full or to within 1-inch of the top edge of the loaf pan. Place one slice of cake on the ice cream. Place the cardboard on top. Bring the pieces of plastic wrap up over the top of the ice cream loaf to cover then place in the freezer. The Baked Alaska may be prepared up to two weeks ahead to this point and stored in the freezer before serving.
            

              About 30 minutes before you plan to serve the dessert place the ice cream loaf in the refrigerator to temper slightly if it is very firm. Turn on your broiler.
            

              Place the egg whites and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. Whisk to combine. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water. Whisk gently until sugar dissolves completely (there should be no gritty feeling when you rub some of the mixture between your thumb and index finger) and the egg whites are uniformly hot (about 130 degrees).
            

              Remove the bowl from the pan and return to the electric mixer. Whip on medium speed until the meringue is cool and increased in volume. It should be stiff but not dry and lumpy.
            

              Unmold the ice cream loaf onto an oven proof serving platter. Top the loaf with another slice of the cake. Frost the cake with the meringue about 1-inch thick. Seal the ice cream loaf completely with meringue. Use a pastry bag fitted with a star tip to pipe additional meringue along the edges for a decorative effect.
            

              Immediately place the cake in the oven. Watch the meringue very closely. As it browns move the pan so that it colors evenly. It should bake no more than 5 or 6 minutes.
            

              Serve at once with red fruit or caramel sauce

              Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Grease a nonstick standard 12 muffin tin and place in the oven to heat while you prepare the batter.
            

              In a large bowl sift together the flour and salt. In a smaller bowl whisk together the eggs milk and melted butter until blended. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and use a whisk to mix them together. Fill each hole in the muffin tin between 2/3 and 3/4 full. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake until they develop a nice brown color an additional 15 minutes; they should feel crusty. Opening the oven door while popovers bake increases the chances they will deflate so look through the window but don't give in to temptation!
            

              Remove the tin from the oven and turn the popovers out onto a flat surface to cool. Pierce the sides with the tip of a small knife to allow steam to escape as they cool. Serve immediately.

Chocolate Caramel-Creme Candy Cake Recipe | Food Network Kitchen | Food Network, 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter melted and slightly cooled plus more for the pan 1 cup all-purpose flour (see Cook's Note) plus more for the pan 1 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup buttermilk at room temperature 1 large egg at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup heavy cream at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/4 teaspoons unflavored gelatin (about 1/2 of one 1/4-ounce packet) 4 ounces cream cheese at room temperature 1/2 cup sour cream at room temperature 8 ounces milk chocolate chips or bars finely chopped 3/4 cup heavy cream ,               Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 8-inch square cake pans line the bottoms with parchment paper. Butter the parchment and dust with flour tapping out excess.
            

              Whisk the flour sugar cocoa powder baking soda baking powder and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk the melted butter buttermilk egg vanilla and 1/2 cup water together in another bowl until smooth. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients whisking until just combined. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans smoothing the tops. Bake rotating the pans halfway through cooking until a toothpick inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean about 25 minutes.
            

              Let the cakes cool in the pans for 15 minutes then turn them out onto a cooling rack set over a baking sheet. Discard the parchment paper and flip the cakes right side up again. Let the cakes cool completely.
            

              Make the caramel creme: Heat 1/2 cup sugar in a small nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook stirring with a rubber spatula until it turns dark amber in color 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and pour in the heavy cream (mixture will bubble up). When the bubbles subside add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and the salt and stir until both dissolve in the caramel. Scrape the caramel into the bowl of a food processor and let cool completely.
            

              Combine the gelatin with 1 tablespoon cold water in a small bowl and let stand for 5 minutes to soften. Heat the gelatin in the microwave until it melts completely about 10 seconds stirring to dissolve. Add the gelatin mixture cream cheese and sour cream to the food processor and process until smooth. Scrape the caramel creme filling into a bowl and refrigerate checking every 5 minutes until it is just thick enough to spread 5 to 15 minutes. (Do not let the filling firm up too much.) Before layering the cake give the mixture a good whisking to aerate it slightly. This will make for a lighter texture.
            

              Place one cake on a cake stand and pile the caramel filling in the center spreading it in a thick layer almost to the edge. Top with the remaining cake aligning the layers directly on top of each other so the cake does not lean. Refrigerate the assembled cake for 1 hour.
            

              Meanwhile make the chocolate ganache: Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan then remove from the heat. Add the chocolate shaking the pan gently to submerge it. Allow the pan to stand off the heat for 3 minutes to melt the chocolate. Whisk the ganache until smooth then refrigerate until it is just thick enough to spread (like mayonnaise) about 15 minutes. (Do not let the ganache harden too much.)
            

              Stir the ganache again and scoop it on top of the cake spreading it over the top and sides. Refrigerate the cake until the ganache is set at least 2 hours or overnight.

Chocolate Whoopie Pies with Fresh Strawberries and Bruleed Marshmallows Recipe | Jeff Mauro | Food Network, 1 stick butter softened 1 1/2 cups light brown sugar 1 egg 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup Dutch process cocoa powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup sour cream 25 strawberries hulled and sliced 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 bag large marshmallows ,               Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with silicon mats or parchment paper and set aside.
            

              For the cookies: Beat the butter and sugar with a hand mixer until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla until just incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
            

              In a separate bowl whisk together the flour cocoa powder baking soda salt and baking powder.
            

              In a third bowl combine the milk and sour cream.
            

              Add half of the milk mixture to butter mixture while mixing on low speed. Then add half of the flour mixture and mix until incorporated. Repeat the process.
            

              With a measured scoop portion out the batter into small rounds on the prepared baking sheets spaced at least an inch apart. You can make the cookies whatever size you like; I like mine a bit big so I use a 4-ounce ice cream scoop.
            

              Bake until the tops lightly spring back when touched 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.
            

              For the filling: Add the sliced strawberries to a bowl and sprinkle with the granulated sugar and let sit for 15 minutes.
            

              Preheat the oven to a broil and set a rack 6 inches from the broiler.
            

              When the cookies are cooled place them round-side down and then top half of them with sliced strawberries.
            

              Press 3 marshmallows together using the palm of your hand until mostly flattened and then place them on the other half of the cookies.
            

              Place the marshmallow-covered cookies back on the baking sheets and place under the broiler to let the marshmallows char and soften until lightly golden on top 1 to 4 minutes. Keep an eye on them as they can burn quickly.
            

              For assembly: Top the strawberry side of the cookie with one of the marshmallow cookies gently press together and then stand back and marvel at your creation.

Veal Blanquette Recipe | Robert Irvine | Food Network, 4 pounds veal breast boned cut in large dice 20 pearl onions 2 quarts beef stock 1 sachet d'epices (1 tablespoon parsley 1 tablespoon peppercorns 1 tablespoon thyme and 1 bay leaf in a cheesecloth bag) 6 tablespoons butter divided 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 6 ounces (about 2 cups) white button mushrooms cleaned and sliced 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 2 egg yolks 1 cup heavy cream ,               Cover the veal with cold water to "blanch" it. Drain and rinse the veal.
            

              Boil about 2 cups of water in a saucepan and then add the pearl onions briefly to scald them. Drain and slip skins from the pearl onions and set them aside.
            

              In a large saucepot combine the veal with the stock and simmer covered over medium-low heat until the veal is tender about 1 1/2 hours. After the veal has been simmering about 30 minutes add the sachet d'epices. Then uncover the pot to allow the stock to reduce to intensify the flavor.
            

              Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a small pot and gradually add the flour to make a white roux. (Do not allow the roux to brown.) Remove and discard the sachet from the stew. Add the roux to the stew pot and simmer until thickened.
            

              In another pan heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and gently cook the pearl onions and mushrooms until they are tender. To this pan add the lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste and set aside.
            

              The heat under the blanquette (stew) must be such that the stew is just below a boil. In a small pot whisk together the egg yolks and cream (known as a liaison) and temper by heating gently and gradually. (You are only heating it. Do not boil. Do not cook.) Add the liaison to the blanquette. Add the reserved pearl onions and mushrooms. Adjust salt and pepper to taste if needed.

Apple Turnovers with Caramel Sauce and Ice Cream Recipe | Anne Thornton | Food Network, 3 sweet and tart apples such as Granny Smith and Golden Delicious peeled cored and cut into pieces 1/4 cup sugar or cinnamon sugar 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1 (17.3-ounce) package all-butter frozen puff pastry (2 sheets) thawed (recommended: Pepperidge Farm) 1 egg beaten for egg wash Sugar Vanilla ice cream for serving Caramel Sauce recipe follows for serving 1 1/2 cups sugar 1 1/4 cups heavy cream , Watch how to make this recipe.


Pastry:


              For the filling: Put the apples in a medium saucepan and add 1/3 cup water the sugar and lemon juice. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Cover then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the apples are very tender stirring frequently about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat. Gently mash the apples until the mixture is very soft but still chunky. Cool completely.
            

              Position 1 rack in the top third of the oven and 1 rack in the bottom third. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
            

              For the pastry: Stack the pastry sheets together and then roll them out on a lightly floured surface to a 15-inch square. Cut the pastry into 9 (5-inch) squares. Put 1 generous tablespoon apple filling in the middle of each square. Lightly brush the edges of each square with the beaten egg. Fold half of the pastry square over the filling forming triangles. Press and pinch the pastry edges with fingertips or a fork to seal tightly. Chill the turnovers slightly to firm the dough about 15 minutes.
            

              Remove the turnovers from the refrigerator. Make small slits or holes on top of each triangle with a sharp knife or a fork so the steam can escape. Lightly brush the pastry triangles with beaten egg and sprinkle lightly with sugar. Transfer to the baking sheets.
            

              Bake the turnovers until golden brown about 20 minutes. Cool at least 15 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a generous drizzle or pour of Caramel Sauce.
            

Creamy Caramel Sauce:


              Combine the sugar and 1/3 cup water in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. This is the only time you can stir the sugar. If you stir it while it's cooking it turns to rock candy. Place the saucepan over medium to low heat until the sugars start to dissolve 5 to 10 minutes. Then turn the heat up to medium-high and cook until the sugar starts to caramelize 5 to 7 minutes. Do not stir while this is happening. You've got to watch the pot because it goes from caramel to burnt really quickly. And be careful the mixture is extremely hot!
            

              Turn off the heat and stand back to avoid splattering. Slowly add the cream. Don't panic - the cream will bubble violently and the caramel will solidify. Just give it more time to liquefy again-trust me!
            

              Simmer over low heat stirring constantly until the caramel dissolves and the sauce is smooth about 2 minutes. Allow the sauce to cool to room temperature at least 4 hours. It will thicken as it sits.

Red Wagon Pizza Recipe | Food Network, 1 pound whole-grain flour plus more for dusting 10 ounces very cold water 2 teaspoons active dry yeast Sea salt One 16-ounce can crushed tomatoes One 16-ounce can whole Roma tomatoes 1/4 cup oregano 2 tablespoons crushed red pepper 2 tablespoons garlic salt One 16-ounce jar mild banana peppers 8 ounces whole-milk mozzarella 8 ounces whole-milk provolone 1 pound uncooked Italian sausage casings removed 1 small sopressata sliced into long ribbons rather than rounds , Special equipment: a pizza stone

              Pour the flour water and yeast into the bowl of a stand mixer and mix for 2 1/2 minutes. Scrape the bottom of the bowl and mix for another 2 1/2 minutes. Throw 1 tablespoon sea salt on top of the mixed dough; cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. After the dough rests return to the mixer and mix in 1-minute increments until the dough passes a window test to verify gluten development (see Cook's Note).
            

              Once gluten development is verified leave the dough in the mixing bowl cover and place in the refrigerator until it doubles in size about 2 hours.
            

              While the dough is doubling pour the crushed tomatoes and whole tomatoes into a food processor. Add the oregano crushed red pepper and garlic salt and process until smooth. Cover and place in the refrigerator until ready to use.
            

              Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat the oven to the highest temperature it will allow (500 to 550 degrees F; never set it to broil).
            

              Drain the banana peppers. Chop them roughly and set aside.
            

              Grate the mozzarella and provolone and toss them together in a large bowl.
            

              Once the dough has doubled in size divide it into approximately three to four 9-ounce balls. Take 1 ball and reserve the remaining for another use. In the palm of your hand rotate the ball of dough in a circular pattern until the top of the ball is smooth. Don't be afraid of the dough ball. If you mess up just knead the dough and wait for it to rise and try again. Throw some flour down on a clean dry surface and press the dough ball flat. Once the ball is flat focus on the edges of the ball by pressing the edge completely flat against the work surface. This will leave a higher point in the center of the dough ball. Now flip the dough ball over and slowly start to stretch the dough a little at a time from the edge while pushing down slightly in the middle. Again don't be afraid: if you mess up just ball up the dough and wait for it to rise and try again.
            

              The dough should be shaped into a 12- to 14-inch round. Place the round on a flour-dusted pizza peel or cutting board. Ladle some of the tomato sauce onto the dough and float the bottom of the ladle over the dough until the sauce reaches roughly 1/2 inch away from the edge. Do not go over the edge: the sauce will make it difficult for the dough to slide off the peel. Reserve the remaining sauce for another use.
            

              Lightly sprinkle the cheese blend over the sauce being certain to cross the sauce-dough line; this is called anchoring the cheese. You will still want to see some of the sauce through the cheese. Avoid putting too much on; it should be like a screen of cheese.
            

              Crumble some uncooked Italian sausage and sprinkle it evenly onto the pizza. Then sprinkle on some banana peppers.
            

              This next step is important: Take your ribbons of sopressata and curl them into an 'S' shape so they can stand upright allowing the top of the sopressata to cook faster than the cheese.
            

              When building your Red Wagon Pizza always think of the architecture of the pizza and how it will be cut and eaten. This will help you avoid having slices with no ingredients on them.
            

              Slide the pizza onto the pizza stone. If it is not sliding lift the edge and gently blow on the flour to get the dough to float then slide it onto the pizza stone. Bake checking the pizza occasionally until the cheese is golden brown and the crust is cooked through about 8 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven and place it onto a cooling rack to cool for 1 to 2 minutes. Slide it onto a cutting board cut and enjoy!

Excellent Meatballs Recipe | Anne Burrell | Food Network, Extra-virgin olive oil 1 large onion 1/4-inch dice Salt 2 cloves garlic smashed and chopped Pinch crushed red pepper 1/2 pound ground beef 1/2 pound ground veal 1/2 pound ground pork 2 large eggs 1 cup grated Parmigiano 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves 1 cup breadcrumbs 1/2 cup water Marinara Sauce recipe follows 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 pound diced pancetta 2 large Spanish onions cut into 1/4-inch dice Kosher salt 4 large garlic cloves smashed and chopped 4 (28-ounce) cans Italian plum San Marzano tomatoes , Watch how to make this recipe.


              Coat a large saute pan with olive oil add the onions and bring to a medium-high heat. Season the onions generously with salt and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes. The onions should be very soft and aromatic but have no color. Add the garlic and the crushed red pepper and saute for another 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off heat and allow to cool.
            

              In a large bowl combine the meats eggs Parmigiano parsley and bread crumbs. It works well to squish the mixture with your hands. Add the onion mixture and season generously with salt and squish some more. Add the water and do 1 final really good squish. The mixture should be quite wet. Test the seasoning of the mix by making a mini hamburger size patty and cooking it. The mixture should taste really good! If it doesn't it is probably missing salt. Add more. Add more anyway.
            

              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              Shape the meat into desired size. Some people like 'em big some people like 'em small. I prefer meatballs slightly larger than a golf ball. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and bring to a medium-high heat. Brown the meatballs on all sides. Place them on a cookie sheet and bake them in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes or until the meatballs are cooked all the way through. If using right away add them to your big pot of marinara sauce. If not using right away they can be frozen for later use. Serve with pasta and sauce or just eat them straight out of the pot! YUM!
            

Marinara Sauce:


              Coat a large saucepot with olive oil and add the pancetta. Bring the pot to a medium-high heat and cook the pancetta for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the onions season generously with salt and stir to coat with olive oil. Cook the onions for 6 to 7 minutes stirring frequently. The onions should become very soft and aromatic but have no color. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes stirring frequently.
            

              Pass the tomatoes through the food mill. Be sure to pass all of the pulp through the holes leaving only the stems and the seeds and be sure to scrape the pulp off of the bottom of the food mill. That's all of the big money stuff! Add the tomatoes to the pot and rinse out 1 of the empty tomato cans with water and add that water to the pot (about 2 to 3 cups). Season generously with salt and TASTE IT!!!! Tomatoes take a lot of salt. Season in baby steps and taste every step of the way. Cook the sauce for 2 to 3 hours stirring occasionally and tasting frequently.
            

              Use the sauce right away on pasta or for any other tomato sauce need. This sauce can also be cooled and stored in the refrigerator for a few days and freezes really well.

Sandwich Build:


              For the pot roast: Position a rack in the middle position and preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.
            

              Liberally sprinkle the entire roast with salt and pepper. Heat the vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the roast on all sides until golden and caramelized; reduce the heat if the fat begins to smoke. Transfer the roast to a plate and reduce the heat to medium. Add in the onions and saute stirring occasionally until just beginning to brown 8 to 10 minutes. Add the Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper and saute until fragrant another minute. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant about 30 seconds. Deglaze with the red wine and cook until reduced by half. Add in the stock and thyme and bring to a simmer. Adjust the seasoning of the jus. Place the roast back into the pot with any accumulated juices and place in the oven. Cook the roast turning every 30 minutes until very tender 3 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Increase the oven heat to 350 degrees F.
            

              Transfer the roast to a cutting board and tent with foil. Strain the jus through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl and return back to the pot. Bring to a simmer and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Once cooled a bit pull the meat into smaller chunks return to the reduced jus and reserve until ready to build the sandwiches.
            

              For the sweet peppers: Toss the pepper strips with the olive oil granulated garlic and some salt and pepper on a baking sheet. Bake stirring halfway through until lighter in color and soft about 20 minutes.
            

              For the sandwich build: Place some beef on a roll then some sweet peppers and then some Homemade Hot Giardiniera. Pour a small dish of reduced jus. Take the whole sandwich and quickly dunk in hot jus. Using two hands go the hell to town.
            

Homemade Hot Giardiniera:


              Day One: Combine 2 cups water and the salt in a glass or non- reactive bowl. Mix until the salt is dissolved. Add the carrots cauliflower serranos garlic celery and bell peppers to the salt water and stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
            

              Day Two: Drain and rinse the vegetables. In a clean bowl mix together the canola oil with the oregano and pepper. Add the vegetables and mix to combine. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Giardiniera will only get better with time. After 2 days at the most in the bowl you can place in air-tight Mason jars and keep in the fridge for at least 2 to 3 weeks. Makes 3 to 4 cups.

Fresh Blueberry Pie Recipe | Ina Garten | Food Network, 4 cups fresh blueberries washed and dried 1/2 cup sugar plus extra for sprinkling 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tablespoon cassis liqueur 2 Perfect Pie Crusts recipe follows 1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon milk or cream for egg wash 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) very cold unsalted butter 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/3 cup very cold vegetable shortening such as Crisco 1/2 cup ice water ,               Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
            

              Mix the blueberries the 1/2 cup of sugar the flour lemon zest lemon juice and cassis in a large bowl. Carefully ease one pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate making sure not to stretch the dough at all or it will shrink as the pie bakes. With a sharp knife cut the excess dough off at the edge of the pie plate. Spoon the blueberry mixture into the pie shell scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula to be sure you have all the juices.
            

              Brush the edge of the crust with the egg wash. Carefully lay the second crust on top again easing -- not stretching -- it onto the pie. Cut the excess dough off at the edge of the pie plate. Press the two edges together with a dinner fork. Brush the top crust with the eggs wash cut three slits for steam to escape and sprinkle with sugar.
            

              Place the pie on the prepared sheet pan and bake in the middle of the oven for 45 to 50 minutes until the filling is very bubbly and the crust is nicely browned. Allow to cool and serve warm or at room temperature.
            

Perfect Pie Crust:


              Cut the butter in 1/2-inch dice and return it to the refrigerator while you prepare the flour mixture. Place the flour sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse a few times to mix. Add the butter and shortening. Pulse 8 to 12 times until the butter is the size of peas. With the machine running pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball. Dump out onto a floured board and roll into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Chicken Milanese with Escarole Salad and Pickled Red Onions Recipe | Anne Burrell | Food Network, 1/2 cup red wine vinegar 1/2 cup cold water 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon sugar 2 to 3 really good shots hot sauce (recommended: Tabasco) 1 red onion sliced into very thin rings 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 eggs beaten with 1 tablespoon of water 1 1/2 cups panko bread crumbs 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 4 small organic chicken breasts butterflied and lightly pounded to 1/4-inch thick Kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil for frying 1 tablespoon butter 1/2 cup grated pecorino 1/2 cup toasted hazelnuts 2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves 1 head escarole washed spun dry cut into bite size pieces High-quality extra-virgin olive oil , Watch how to make this recipe.


              To make the Pickled Onions: In a small bowl combine red wine vinegar with 1/2 cup of cold tap water. Stir in salt the sugar and the hot sauce. Add the sliced onions and let sit for at least one hour.
            

              To make the Chicken Milanese: Set up a standard breading procedure in 3 wide deep plates. Fill 1 with flour 1 with the beaten eggs and 1 with the panko and grated Parmigiano. Season the chicken breasts with salt. Using one hand for dry things and 1 hand for wet things take each piece of chicken through the breading procedure: dredge lightly in the flour then the egg wash and then through the bread crumbs. Lay the breaded chicken on a sheet tray and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
            

              Pour olive oil into a large saute pan until it reaches a thickness of about a half an inch - better a little more rather than a little less. Bring to a medium-high heat and add butter. Test the oil by flicking flour or bread crumbs into the oil. If it doesn't sizzle-WAIT! When the oil is hot test it again by dipping the edge of a piece of chicken into the oil the oil should gently sizzle. Cook the chicken in the oil in batches on both sides until it is a lovely golden brown color and is crispy about 4 to 5 minutes. Do not crowd the pan or the chicken will become very greasy and soggy. When the chicken comes out of the oil lay it on paper towels to drain off the excess oil and sprinkle with salt. You can keep the chicken in a low oven to keep it warm while the rest of the chicken is cooking.
            

              To make the Escarole Salad: Combine the pecorino hazelnuts and parsley in the food processor and pulse until they are coarsely chopped. Toss together the escarole hazelnut mixture and some of the pickled red onions and dress with some of the pickling liquid and olive oil. Season with salt.
            

              Place chicken on each serving plate and top with the escarole salad.

Raspberry-Lemon Easter Cake Recipe | Food Network Kitchen | Food Network, 3 cups cake flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 1/4 cups sour cream 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 1 1/2 lemons) 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter room temperature cut into small pieces 2 cups sugar 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 5 large eggs room temperature 1 1/4 cups sugar 5 large egg whites 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar Pinch fine salt 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter room temperature cut into small pieces 1/2 cup seedless red raspberry jam Rabbit Sugar Cookies homemade or store bought recipe follows Pastel sanding sugars Candied almonds 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter at room temperature 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar 2 large eggs 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla paste or vanilla extract , Icing and Filling:


              For the cakes:
            

              Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Lightly brush 2 (9-inch) round cake pans with shortening or butter. Line bottoms with buttered parchment paper and dust with flour.
            

              Sift the flour baking powder soda and salt into a medium bowl; whisk to combine evenly. Stir the sour cream lemon juice and vanilla together in a liquid measuring cup and set aside.
            

              Beat the butter in a standing mixer with the paddle attachment on high until light and creamy about 2 minutes. Stop and scrape butter off the sides of the bowl. Continue beating while gradually adding the sugar-- it should take a couple minutes to add all the sugar. Continue beating until very light and fluffy about 3 to 4 minutes more. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat in the lemon zest. Add the eggs 1 at a time beating well after each addition.
            

              At low speed add the flour mixture in 3 parts alternating with the sour cream in 2 parts beginning and ending with the flour. Scrape the sides of the bowl and mix for 15 seconds longer.
            

              Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the top with a knife. (Lightly tap the pan on the counter so the batter settles evenly.)
            

              Bake the cakes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean about 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pan on a rack for 20 minutes; then turn cakes out onto the rack to cool completely.
            

              For the Icing:
            

              Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a mixer's bowl above the water. Whisk the sugar the egg whites lemon juice cream of tartar and salt in the bowl by hand. Set the bowl above the boiling water and continue whisking until the mixture is hot to the touch and the sugar dissolves about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the bowl to a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat the whites at medium-high speed until they almost holds a stiff peak and are cool about 10 minutes. Beat in the butter a little at a time until the icing is smooth and spreadable. (If the icing separates just keep beating and it will come back together.)
            

              To assemble the cake:
            

              Slice each cake in half horizontally with a serrated knife to make 4 even layers taking care that they are as flat and straight as possible.
            

              Set a large flat plate on a large inverted bowl or bottom of a salad spinner (of course if you have a cake stand use that) dabbing a little frosting on the bottom of the plate to secure it. Place a cake layer top side up on the plate. Using an offset spatula spread about half of the jam in a thin layer over the first cake layer leaving about 1/4-inch border along the outside. Lay the second cake layer on top stacking it as straight as possible. Using an offset spatula spread about 1 cup of the icing on the top layer. Place a third cake layer on top.
            

              Spread remaining red raspberry jam over the cake layer and place the final layer on top pressing down lightly to secure all 4 layers together. Spread about 3/4 of the remaining icing around the sides with a knife or offset spatula then ice the top of the cake. Use an offset spatula to smooth icing as much as possible. Press plain or iced cookies around the sides taking care to leave space to cut the cake. Garnish with additional candied almonds and sprinkle the top of the cake with pastel colored sanding sugars. Serve immediately or set aside at room temperature for up to 2 hours before serving. If refrigerating the cake bring to room temperature 30 minutes before serving.
            

Sugar Cookies for Decorating (and eating):


              Whisk the flour baking powder and salt in a medium bowl.
            

              Beat the butter and both sugars in another medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy about 30 seconds. Add the eggs and vanilla mixing until fully incorporated. Slowly add the flour mixture and continue beating just until the dough comes together stopping and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
            

              Divide dough in half pat into disks wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm at least 2 hours.
            

              Generously flour a clean work surface. (For a nice even layer of flour lightly sift flour over the work surface.) Gently roll chilled dough about 1/4-inch thick. Cut into desired shape using a cookie cutter working quickly enough so dough remains chilled. If dough gets too soft refrigerate on a lined baking sheet until firm again about 30 minutes.
            

              Transfer cut cookies to un-greased baking sheets leaving about 1-inch between cookies. Refrigerate the formed cookies for at least 30 minutes. Lightly dust off excess flour with a dry pastry brush. (Excess dough can be pressed into a disk chilled and rerolled.)
            

              Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Bake the cookies until the bottoms are golden about 12 to 15 minutes depending on shape. Cool on the baking sheets until firm enough to transfer to a rack to cool. Decorate as desired and serve. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.

              Remove the cooked pieces with a slotted spoon (you could keep them in a bowl covered in aluminum foil to keep them warm) and turn the heat up under the pan to let the liquid boil down to a thick dark syrup.
            

              Return the chicken pieces back to the pan stir well so that all the chicken pieces are coated in the sticky savory syrup. Serve with a comforting pile of sushi rice and perhaps some steamed baby bok choy or other veggies of your choice.

Tradesmen's Tri-Seafood Salad with Basil Parmesan Vinaigrette Recipe | Robert Irvine | Food Network, 2 fresh lemons 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar 3 garlic cloves minced 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 3 tablespoons chopped chives 1/2 packed cup fresh basil leaves chopped 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 2 1/4 cups extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper 1 (16-ounce) can dark red kidney beans 1 (16-ounce) can chick peas (garbanzo beans) 1 pound fresh green beans trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths and steamed until just tender and allowed to cool 1 (16-ounce) can artichoke hearts quartered 1 (16-ounce) can pitted black olives drained 1 pound tri-color rotini pasta boiled until al dente and allowed to cool 1 pound bay scallops steamed until opaque and allowed to cool 3 (6-ounce) cans rock shrimp drained 3 (6-ounce) cans albacore tuna drained and separated into chunks 1 (8-ounce) bag fresh frozen peas blanched drained and cooled 1 pint grape tomatoes halved 12 basil sprigs for garnish Shaved Parmesan for garnish ,               Prepare the vinaigrette just before use. Place the lemons in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave until the essential oils in the skin are released. Since these will be hot coming from the microwave you will need to set them aside briefly until they cool just enough to handle. Pour vinegar into a blender turn it on and then squeeze in 1emon juice from the micro-waved lemons. Leaving the blender running add 1 at a time through the feed opening: garlic mustard chives basil Parmesan and pepper and blend until smooth. While keeping the blender running add oil through the feed opening in a slow stream. Set aside until needed.
            

              In a large mixing bowl combine kidney beans chick peas green beans artichoke hearts and black olives. Dress with enough vinaigrette to coat well then gently fold in pasta scallops shrimp tuna peas and grape tomatoes. Taste and adjust dressing as needed. Do not feel compelled to use all of the dressing. You want enough to complement the ingredients of the salad without overcoming their flavors. (You can always serve dressing on the side or add more to the salad if you wish. The pasta will absorb some of the vinaigrette.)
            

              Transfer to serving bowls or serve family style. Garnish with basil sprigs and shaved Parmesan.

Omelet with Onions, Zucchini, and Fontina Recipe | Anne Burrell | Food Network, Extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup diced onions cut 1/4-inch Kosher salt 1/4 cup diced zucchini green part only cut 1/4-inch 2 eggs beaten until smooth with 2 tablespoons water seasoned lightly with salt 1/2 cup grated fontina cheese 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives divided Mesclun Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette recipe follows 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 clove garlic smashed and finely chopped Kosher salt 1 1/2 cups mesclun mix 1/2 cucumber peeled sliced and slices cut in half 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes cut in half 1/4 small red onion thinly sliced 1 small block Parmigiano-Reggiano ,               Coat a small nonstick saute pan lightly with olive oil. Add the onions season with salt and bring the pan to a medium heat. Cook the onions stirring occasionally for 3 to 4 minutes.
            

              Add the zucchini and season lightly with salt. Cook the onions and zucchini stirring occasionally until the zucchini is soft 3 to 4 minutes.
            

              Add the beaten egg mixture (be sure that the mixture is smooth-no hunks of egg white). Using a small heatproof rubber spatula stir the zucchini mixture throughout the eggs. Don't worry about messing up the eggs they will smooth out. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked egg mixture to run to the sides of the pan to create a wide flat "scrambled egg". Swirl the pan around occasionally to loosen the eggs from the bottom of the pan.
            

              When the eggs are three-quarters of the way cooked through sprinkle the middle third of the omelet with the grated fontina and most of the chives (save some chives for garnish). Turn off the heat.
            

              Using the spatula fold the left third of the omelet over the cheese/chive mixture. Press gently to secure.
            

              Gently shake the pan to be sure that the omelet is loosened from the pan. Gently lay the right third of the omelet down on a serving plate and flip the other 2/3 of the omelet on top. The omelet should be folded like a letter.
            

              Garnish the top with the remaining chives and serve with Mesclun Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette.
            

Salad:


              For the vinny: In a small mixing bowl combine the vinegar and mustard. Mix until smooth. While mixing start adding the oil into the vinegar/mustard mix drop by drop. Really-one drop at a time! One the drop has mixed in add the next drop-this shouldn't really be an arm workout.
            

              When the mixture starts to look smooth and velvety the oil can be added a little bit faster. Continue this way until all the oil has been added. When done it should look very smooth shiny and homogeneous.
            

              Add the garlic and season with salt. Taste it it should taste good! Season with salt again if needed.
            

              To assemble the salad: Toss together the mesclun cukes tomatoes and onions. Dress lightly with the vinaigrette. (You will not need to use all the dressing you made. Store the extra in the fridge and bring to room temperature when ready to use.)
            

              Season vinaigrette with salt if needed. Taste! The salad should be very flavorful but not soggy.
            

              Plate the salad piling it up so the lettuce looks fluffy and healthy and is adorned with the veggies. Using a veggie peeler shave the cheese on top.

Miso-Braised Short Ribs Tempura Recipe | Masaharu Morimoto | Food Network, 8 meaty short ribs on the bone cut 3 to 4 inches long (about 3 pounds) 3 quarts water 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 1 teaspoon white peppercorns 1 teaspoon Szechuan peppercorns 2 bay leaves 2 sprigs fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried 2 quarts Shanton Broth (rich meat-flavored broth) 1/4 cup red miso Vegetable oil for deep-frying 1 cup all-purpose flour Small-Batch Tempura Batter recipes follows 1 egg yolk 1/4 cup vegetable oil 3/4 cup chilled club soda 1 cup all-purpose flour ,               Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.
            

              Trim off any excess fat from the short ribs. In a large saucepan or flameproof casserole combine 3 quarts of water the black white and Szechuan peppercorns bay leaves and thyme. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add the short ribs and partially cover the pot. Reduce the heat to low. Simmer the ribs skimming off any foam from the surface until the meat is almost tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife about 1 1/2 hours. Do not overcook because the ribs will cook further in 2 later steps. Remove the ribs from the braising liquid and let cool to room temperature.
            

              Bring the Shanton Broth and red miso to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat whisking to dissolve the miso. Add the short ribs and reduce the heat to low. Simmer uncovered turning occasionally until the ribs are very tender but not falling apart about 1 1/2 hours. Using a slotted spoon transfer the short ribs to a plate and let cool completely. Then remove the meat from the bones trying to keep each rib in 1 chunk.
            

              While the ribs are cooling skim off as much fat as you can from the Shanton-Miso broth. Boil over high heat until the liquid is reduced to 1 cup about 20 minutes. Strain the sauce and set aside. (The short ribs and sauce can be prepared up to 1 day ahead separately cooled covered and refrigerated. Remove from the refrigerator at least 1 hour before deep-frying.)
            

              Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or pour vegetable oil into a large saucepan to reach halfway up the sides. Heat over high heat to 350 degrees F.
            

              Working with half of the short ribs at a time coat the ribs with the all-purpose flour shaking off any excess. Dip in the tempura batter and let extra batter drip back into the bowl. Add the coated ribs to the hot oil and deep-fry until light golden brown about 2 minutes. Using a slotted skimmer transfer to a wire rack set on a baking sheet to drain. Keep warm in the low oven while frying the remaining short ribs.
            

              To serve spoon equal amounts of the sauce onto 4 dinner plates. Top each with 2 pieces of Short Rib Tempura and serve immediately.

New England Pot Roast and Gravy Recipe | Food Network, 2 Fresh raw Briskets** (about 22 pounds) preferably Certified Black Angus Beef (they come about 11 pounds each) 2 1/2 pounds onions 2 1/2 pounds carrots 2 pounds celery 3 gallons beef stock approximately 2 teaspoons herb de Provence seasoning blend 1 teaspoon dry thyme or fresh if available 3 bay leaves Salt and black pepper (sprinkle generously unless using some form of bouillon for stock that is already salty) 1 gallon pot roast stock 1 cup beef fat 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup cornstarch for shine Garnish: Julienne carrots celery and onion (just a few for presentation) ,               With a hot broiler grill or frying pan sear the briskets until they're well browned and crispy. Wash and cut the vegetables into a large rough dice and place in the bottom of a large covered pan (squarehead). Add the beef seasonings and stock. Cover and place in a preheated 375 to 400 degree oven and bake for about 6 hours. Check the meat with a meat fork. The briskets should be extremely fork tender (practically falling apart). When done lift from the stock with a fork and a spatula underneath to a holding pan to cool slightly.
            

              Meanwhile -- into a large plastic food bucket strain the vegetables and stock through a medium hole china cap (sieve). Using a mallet or ladle squeeze some of the vegetable pulp through into the stock for flavor and texture. Discard the squeezed veggies. Cool the stock so the fat will rise to the top.
            

              While the meat is still warm cut out the large pieces of meat separating it from the fat layer in the middle. Scrape off any excess soft fat and discard it. Keep the meat pieces (pot roast) to eat soon or refrigerate them.
            

              To Make Gravy: Heat the Pot Roast Stock separately. In a large heavy saucepan heat the beef fat boiling out any water particles (takes a couple minutes). Make a roux by whisking in the flour and cornstarch stirring constantly -- cooking a few minutes. Continue stirring (it could burn) browning slightly is okay. It adds color to the gravy. Add some of the hot stock gradually. Stir swiftly to break up lumps and make a smooth paste. Add more stock to thin to the desired consistency. Let simmer 20 to 25 minutes stirring occasionally. Check for color taste and thickness. Adjust color if desired with a few drops of Gravy Master or Kitchen Bouquet. Add salt and pepper and more stock if needed.
            

              Garnish: Simmer carrots celery and onion in a little stock to soften slightly. Cool until needed. Dip in stock to reheat and arrange on top of gravy on the meat.
            

              Slowly reheat Pot Roast in hot stock. Remove from stock to a cutting board. Slice the meat thinly on the bias against the grain of the meat. Arrange on the plate ladle on the gravy and garnish with the julienne vegetables if desired. Serve with fresh mashed potatoes and a vegetable. This is a meal to enjoy.

              For the Base: Using an offset spatula spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of white chocolate over a sheet of bubble wrap making sure to create a big enough base to support the rest of your design. When that has set repeat the procedure using bittersweet chocolate. Let the chocolate set slightly. If you want to trim the outside edge to a specific shape use a paring knife to make that cut before the chocolate has set completely. When the chocolate is set peel off the bubble wrap.
            

              For the Tube: Cut a piece of acetate the length and width of the tube you would like to make and set it on your work surface. Make cocoa butter paint by mixing cocoa butter with powdered food coloring to desired consistency and place it in a shallow dish. Dip the stenciled paint roller in the cocoa butter paint and roll onto the acetate. When the paint has set use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of white chocolate over the painted acetate paper. Roll the acetate into a tube so the acetate is on the outside and tape it closed. Set aside and allow the chocolate to set. When the chocolate has set remove the acetate. If you need to trim the tube to fit your presentation heat a chef's knife and let the heat of the knife cut the chocolate. Do not apply pressure or your tube will break.
            

              For the Dome: Coat the inside of your dome mold with cocoa butter paint. When the chocolate has set use a ladle to fill the mold with white chocolate. (It will make an interesting marbled effect if you spread the chocolate around with your fingers.) When the mold is full empty the chocolate back into the bowl. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the lip of the mold clean and place it upside down on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden about 5 minutes scrape the lip of the mold clean again with a paring knife. This is important because when the chocolate sets it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. When the chocolate has set unmold it by gently pressing on one side of the chocolate. The chocolate should release easily.
            

              For the Textured Plastic: Cut shapes from heavy textured plastic. Spread chocolate all the way to the edge of the plastic and let it set. When it has set carefully peel the plastic away from the chocolate and set aside. You can make textured chocolate triangles by using a sharp paring knife to cut out triangles when the chocolate is partially set. Tile the triangles so they overlap slightly and use chocolate to "glue" them together. If trimming is necessary use a hot chef's knife to "cut" the chocolate.
            

              For the Sea Sponge: Using sea sponge dipped in cocoa butter paint sponge paint onto an acetate sheet. Another method is to spread white chocolate onto an acetate sheet let it set then sponge paint on top of the chocolate.
            

              For the Marbled Chocolate Box: Using a spoon drizzle white and bittersweet chocolate inside a plastic box. Use your fingers to spread the chocolate and create a marbled effect. Using a ladle fill the box with white chocolate and when it's full empty it back into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the box should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the lip of the plastic box clean and place the box upside down on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden about 5 minutes scrape the lip of the box clean again with a paring knife. This is important because when the chocolate sets it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden.
            

              If you are very adventurous you can give the molded box an interesting finish by using a paint spray gun instead however the spray gun must be unused. Start by placing the mold in the freezer for 10 minutes. Mix equal parts of cocoa butter and melted chocolate together and strain the mixture. Pour it into the spray gun container making sure it is very warm. Remove the mold from the freezer and use the spray gun to "paint" the outside of the mold.
            

              How to Temper Chocolate (From Dessert Circus Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):
            

              Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper.
            

              One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate's residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually chocolate begins to set or crystallize along the side of the bowl. As it sets mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.
            

              Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this or a whisk.
            

              The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work requires a lot of room and makes a big mess.
            

              A simple method of checking tempering is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.

Cast Iron Skillet Potato Cake Recipe | Alex Guarnaschelli | Food Network, 1 to 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter 6 large Idaho baker potatoes washed and peeled Kosher salt 2 teaspoons dried thyme ,               The thing about trying to cook meals on a budget they often end up making me feel like I didn't make anything special. Then I put a call in to my inner chef and realized that with a few ingredients and a little elbow grease I can make something that feels fancy and exciting without breaking the bank.
            

              In a small saucepan melt the butter and bring it to a gentle simmer. Shut off the heat and allow it to sit a minute on the stove. The milk solids should start to sink to the bottom. Slowly pour the butter into a bowl keeping as much of the white milky liquid as possible in the saucepan. Discard the milk solids; these are prone to burning and by clarifying the butter the potato cake will be less likely to overbrown. Keep the butter warm on the stove.
            

              Using a mandolin slicer or a sharp knife cut all of the potatoes into thin (1/8-inch thick) slices. Transfer them to a bowl and cover them with 3/4 of the melted butter. Season with a little salt and the dried thyme and toss to coat the potatoes with the butter. Pour the remaining butter in the bottom of the cast iron skillet and swirl it around to coat the bottom and sides.
            

              Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
            

              Remember that the bottom layer with be the top when you unmold this cake so it should be done with extra care. Layer the potatoes following the edge of the skillet so they overlap. Start the second circle closer to the center of overlapping potato rounds. Continue to make circles with the potatoes until the entire bottom of the skillet is filled with potato rounds in smaller and smaller circles. Fill the skillet with another level layer of potatoes. Sprinkle a touch of salt and make 3 more layers. Press down gently on the potatoes to make sure they are starting to stick together and form a cake.
            

              Place the skillet on high heat and cook until the water starts to emerge from the potatoes and you can see the edges browning 5 to 8 minutes. Place the skillet in the oven and cook undisturbed until the potatoes feel tender in the center when pierced with the tip of a knife 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the skillet and carefully pour off any excess butter or liquid into a bowl. Place the skillet on a flat surface and cover it with a platter larger than the skillet. Carefully turn the platter over in one deft motion. Lift off the skillet and use a large metal spatula to place it back in the skillet so it can brown on the second side. Pour the butter back in and cook in the oven for an additional 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from the oven. Pour off any liquid. Season with salt. Cut into wedges like a pie. Serve immediately in the skillet. Alternatively lift it out of the skillet and serve on a platter or in slices on individual plates.

Lightly dust the filled wontons with cornstarch to keep them from sticking together and place them on a cookie sheet. (When these are folded they look like Pope hats.)
            

              Heat 2 to 3 inches of oil in a deep heavy saucepan to 370 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Add a few of the wontons to the oil and cook turning them 3 or 4 times to get them nicely browned all over. Carefully lift them out of the pan with a slotted spoon and onto a paper towel-lined platter to drain. Keep going to cook all of the wontons.

Gravy from Roast Drippings Recipe | Alton Brown | Food Network, 1 cup red wine 2 cups beef chicken or vegetable broth 1 bay leaf 5 to 6 black peppercorns ,               Remove roast from pan and pour off any fat. Place over high heat (use 2 burners if necessary) and deglaze pan with wine and broth scraping any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula. Once these solids are dissolved pour liquid into a saucepan and add the bay leaf and peppercorns. Reduce for 5 minutes over high heat or until reduced by 1/3.
            

              At this point you basically have a jus which could be used to sauce your roast. To create a gravy reduce the heat to medium and whisk in 2 tablespoons of white roux. Return to a simmer whisking constantly. Continuing to cook once a simmer has been reached will result in a smoother sauce but not a thicker one.
            

              Since all starch thickened sauces thicken as they cool it's a good idea to make your gravy a little on the loose side.

Sunny's Autumn Fried Turkey Recipe | Sunny Anderson | Food Network, 1/4 cup kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns 1 bunch fresh sage 1 bunch fresh thyme 1 lemon halved One 14- to 16-pound turkey gizzards and neck removed One 14- to 16-pound turkey gizzards and neck removed 1/2 cup pumpkin pie spice 4 teaspoons hot Hungarian paprika 4 teaspoons kosher salt 3 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Olive oil for drizzling Vegetable or canola oil for deep-frying , Watch how to make this recipe.

Special equipment: a brining bag (optional) and an electric turkey deep-fryer

              Three days before roasting the turkey make the brine.
            

              For the brine: In a large pot on medium-high heat add 6 quarts (24 cups) water and the salt peppercorns sage thyme and lemon. Bring to a boil lower to a simmer and simmer until the salt is dissolved and the water is fragrant. Turn off the heat and let cool.
            

              Put the turkey in a brining bag large plastic bag or a bowl large enough to fit it with still more space to give. Pour in the cooled brining liquid and seal or cover. If there's not enough room for all of the liquid in the brine be sure to at least include the herbs lemon and peppercorns in with the turkey for brining. Refrigerate for 3 days.
            

              When ready to cook remove the turkey from the refrigerator and discard all of the brining liquid and solids. Pat the turkey dry with paper towels.
            

              For the rub: In a medium bowl mix the pumpkin pie spice paprika salt cumin and pepper. Rub the mixture on all sides of the turkey and drizzle lightly with olive oil. Leave at room temperature for 2 hours. (If you have an extra day in your planning leave it in the refrigerator overnight uncovered. This will help dry the skin more then when ready to fry remove from the refrigerator and let rest at room temperature for 2 hours.)
            

              Fill the fryer with vegetable or canola oil and heat to 350 degrees F according to the manufacturer's instructions (see Cook's Note).
            

              Cook the bird for approximately 3 minutes per pound and then add an additional 5 minutes onto the cooking time. A 15-pound bird will take about 50 minutes. (Check the cooking times on your fryer; cook according to instructions and fry for the correct time according to weight.) Remove to a paper towel-lined platter and allow to rest for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour so the juices can redistribute then carve.

Liberty Chocolates Recipe | Food Network, 2 cups heavy cream 21 ounces bittersweet chocolate finely chopped Splash Grand Marnier Liberty molds 16 ounces white chocolate tempere , Special equipment: Liberty molds

              Heat the heavy cream in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan until bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan. Make sure you chopped the chocolate as finely as possible to allow it to melt quickly and easily. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl. Make a ganache by pouring about 1/2 of the hot cream over the chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Then slowly whisk until smooth and homogenous. Do not add all of the hot cream to the cold chocolate at once. The shock of the temperature extremes will cause the fat in the chocolate to separate. As the chocolate melts you will see some elasticity if there is no fat separation. This means the chocolate still has an emulsion; the fat molecules are still holding together. If the ganache separates it loses its elasticity collapses and becomes very liquid. I use a hand-held immersion blender to ensure a smooth ganache and to keep the emulsion of the chocolate. Add the remaining cream gradually and mix until all of the hot cream is incorporated and the ganache is smooth and homogenous.
            

              If the ganache separates it is very easy to fix. Simply add a small amount of cold cream and whisk well. This will bring the ganache back together. The ganache should be thick shiny and smooth. Add the desired flavoring and mix until fully incorporated. Pour the ganache onto a plastic wrap-covered baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Cover the ganache with plastic wrap and allow it to cool for at least 4 hours at room temperature. I usually make the ganache at the end of the day and let it cool overnight. As it cools it will thicken and set.
            

              Use a ladle to fill the mold with white chocolate. When it is full empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden about 5 minutes scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden.
            

              Use a spatula to spread some of the cooled ganache into the chocolate mold. Fill it just short of the top so there will be room to close the chocolates. When finished use a spatula to spread tempered white chocolate over the ganache. Allow this to set. When the chocolate has set completely unmold the chocolates.

Mint Chutney:


              Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
            

              Filling: In a small saucepan add the potato and enough cold water to cover. Add a generous pinch of salt and bring to a boil over medium heat then reduce the heat and simmer until tender 12 to 15 minutes.
            

              In a second small saucepan bring 4 cups water to a simmer and add a generous pinch of salt bay leaves 1 teaspoon coriander seeds peppercorns chili flakes and chicken breast. Simmer until cooked through 8 to 10 minutes.
            

              Mash the potato and finely shred the chicken and put into a large bowl. Combine with mango lime juice chipotle sauce remaining coriander seeds cumin cilantro and salt and pepper to taste. Mixing with a spoon or your hands until well incorporated. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary. Set aside.
            

              Samosas: Roll the puff pastry out slightly to flatten the seams. Using a paring knife to trace a 7-inch ring mold or bowl cut the dough into 8 (7-inch wide) rounds. Cut each into 2 semicircles.
            

              Put a tablespoon or so of the filling in the center of a semicircle. Have a small bowl of water handy. Dip your finger in the water and run it along the edges of the semicircle. Arrange the samosas so the flat side is facing away from you. Grab the left corner and fold it over the dough in a triangular motion so that this corner lands on the bottom right side of the filling. Do the same with the other corner.
            

              Squeeze bottom shut and fold over sealing with water. If you like seal using a fork. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Arrange the 8 samosas on a lightly greased baking sheet.
            

              In a small bowl whisk the egg and 1 teaspoon water with a fork until thoroughly combined. Brush the tops of the samosas with the egg wash.
            

              Bake for 15 minutes at 425 degrees F then turn heat down to 375 degrees F and bake for 10 more minutes. You can flip them over just before you turn the heat down if you like.
            

              Chutney: In a food processor whiz together the mint cilantro ginger lime juice and water until it all comes together as a sauce. There'll probably still be little bits of leaf in the sauce but I like how those taste so no worries. Pour the chutney into a bowl.
            

              In a small pan over medium heat warm the oil until it shimmers. Add mustard seeds; they should sizzle. Immediately cover with a lid until they stop spluttering. Make sure they don't burn! If they do start over. No big deal. I do it all the time! Immediately add the seeds and oil to the chutney. It will sizzle so stand back. Once you've poured in all of the oil you can even spoon a little chutney into the pan (cue sizzling again!) so that you pick up all that lovely oil. Pour into the bowl with the chutney.
            

              Serve samosas hot with the chutney... and bask in gratitude for the great ideas we all come up with for our sensitive taste buds and for the blessing of good friends!
            

Homemade Samosa Pastry:


              In large bowl combine the flour buttermilk oil salt and ajwain seeds. Bring the ingredients together until a dough forms. Knead until it has softened a bit about 5 minutes. Allow to rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. You can put this in the refrigerator but make sure you let it sit at room temperature for 20 minutes or so in order for it to soften.
            

              Roll the dough into a short cylinder. Slice in half then slice each half into 2 pieces so you have 4 bits. Roll each bit into a ball. Flatten the balls into discs then on a floured surface roll them into a 1/8-inch thick 7-inch wide circles. Cut in half to form 2 semicircles.

Continue to cook the grits over medium-low heat stirring frequently until they are soft and thick about 10 to 15 minutes. Cover the pot and allow the grits to sit for 5 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup cream pimientos and cheese and stir to combine. Just before serving check the consistency of the grits. Stir in the additional 1/4 cream if necessary to thin them out.
            

              Prepare the sweet potato frizzles: Peel and grate the sweet potato using the large holes in a box grater. Using a tea towel squeeze as much liquid as possible from the potato. Carefully drop the dry potato shreds in the oil once it reaches 350 degrees F. Fry for about 1 minute until crispy and lightly browned. Remove from oil drain on paper towels and season lightly with salt.
            

              Prepare the watercress salad: Grate the onion using a box grater. In a jar or shaker mix the onion sugar vinegar oil and salt. Shake vigorously until blended. Just before plating the salad drizzle about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the dressing over the watercress and toss gently to coat.
            

              Preparing the chops: (Note the chops are fully cooked so the preparation is to give them color glaze them and heat them through.)
            

              Preheat a large grill pan to medium-high heat. Brush each chop with about a tablespoon of oil and season scantily with salt and pepper. Be cautious about oversalting the chops since they are generally salty. Place the chops on the grill pan. Allow to sear for about 1 to 3 minutes and then rotate the chop to get nice hash marks on the chop for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn chops over. Cook on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes total. Reduce heat. A few minutes before serving spoon about a teaspoon of glaze over each chop. Turn over and repeat being careful not to burn the glaze.
            

              To serve: Place a mound of the grits on each plate. Lean a chop next to the grits. Sprinkle about a tablespoon of sweet potato atop the grits/chop. On the side of the chop mound a serving of the dressed watercress. Drizzle a tablespoon or so of the glaze over the chop and allow it to run into the grits.

Run the mixture through a meat grinder fitted with the die with the largest holes. Repeat so that all the meat goes through the grinder twice. Add the water and Parmesan and mix together.
            

              Attach the sausage-stuffing attachment to the meat grinder keeping the grinder blade and die in place. Place a generous amount of the sausage mixture into the grinder pan. Give the casings a slight bit of resistance by holding onto the sausage stuffer with three fingers and letting the casing slip through your thumb and forefinger. Turn the machine on and fill the casings being careful to avoid any air bubbles.
            

              Twist the casings to create evenly-sized 4-inch sausages. Tie the sausages with butcher's twine to keep them nicely sealed then prick all over with a pin or skewer to allow steam to escape while cooking (you don't want to have a blow-out!).
            

              Place the sausage links into boiling water and parboil for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the water reserving the sausage water for spätzle and transfer sausages to a preheated saute pan slicked with oil. Saute until browned about 6 minutes.
            

              For the spaetzle: Bring the sausage water back to a boil over medium heat.
            

              In a small bowl whisk together the eggs and milk until homogeneous.
            

              Add the flour to a large bowl and make a well in the flour. Add a pinch of salt and then with a fork gradually combine the milk-egg mixture with the flour. Mix until just combined. Stir in half of the dill marjoram oregano and parsley (1/4 cup total).
            

              Place the batter in a colander set over the boiling sausage water. Using a rubber spatula or a spaetzle maker push the batter through the colander and into the water. Boil the spaetzle until firm 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and add to a preheated saute pan slicked with oil. Add the savoy cabbage white wine and mustard and cook for 15 to 20 minutes. Finish with the butter.
            

              Serve 2 sausages to a plate with herb spaetzle on the side.

Lilac-or Chocolate-Topped Cupcakes Recipe | Nigella Lawson | Food Network, 3/4 cup self-rising flour 1/2 cup very soft unsalted butter 7 tablespoons sugar 2 eggs 1 to 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Few tablespoons whole milk Approximately 1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar sifted or instant royal icing 1 to 2 tablespoons water Food coloring paste I'm using Grape Violet Gold chocolate button (or any candy coated chocolate) 1 recipe Chocolate Ganache recipe follows 7 ounces bittersweet chocolate with a minimum 70 percent cocoa solids chopped or use chocolate buttons 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream , Special equipment: 1 (12-cup) cupcake pan or 3 (12-cup) mini-cupcake pans with appropriately sized paper baking cups

For the icing:


              Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
            

For the cupcakes:


              Put all the ingredients for the cupcakes except the milk into a food processor and blitz furiously. Then pour in the milk and process again until you have a smooth batter. Divide the mixture between either the big muffin pans or the 3 small pans.
            

              Cook the big cupcakes for about 15 to 20 minutes and the small ones for about 10 minutes although you might need to keep a closer eye on the little ones. Cool the cupcakes on a wire rack.
            

For the icing:


              To ice the mini-cupcakes mix the confectioners' sugar with a tablespoon or 2 of water from a recently boiled kettle or cold water (according to package instructions) for instant royal icing until you have a smooth spreadable paste. In both cases add water slowly: you don't want this runny and nothing is more irritating than having to start sifting more sugar. The merest tiniest blob of food-coloring paste- in this case as I said Grape Violet - will be enough to bring a dizzy and rich-toned intensity to the proceedings; you can always add more coloring if you want but again the important thing is to guard against having to do any more sifting. And if you have been too heavy-handed and landed yourself with a batch of unusable dark icing then just make up some more plain white icing and add to tone down.
            

              Slice any peaking humps off the tops of the cakes with a sharp knife and then pour from a dunked-in spoon the icing over each cake until the tops are thickly and smoothly covered. Let stand for a couple of minutes until the icing has set a tiny bit and then dot a gold button or other decoration of your choice on top.
            

Chocolate Ganache:


              Put both ingredients in a saucepan and over low heat cook until the chocolate's melted. Whisk together with handheld mixer or electric whisk (for ease and preference) watching the mixture become thick and glossy. Spoon and smooth over your waiting cupcakes. . Let stand for a couple of minutes until the icing has set a tiny bit and then decorate in whatever way you want.

Pan-Roasted Turchetta Recipe | Guy Fieri | Food Network, Extra-virgin olive oil 6 cloves garlic peeled and smashed 2 tablespoons rubbed sage 1 1/2 tablespoons fennel seeds 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves Freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon chile flakes Kosher salt One (6-pound) whole boneless turkey breast both lobes connected breast bone removed skin on 1/2 cup chicken stock , Watch how to make this recipe.

Special equipment: butcher's twine

              In a mortar and pestle combine 2 tablespoons olive oil garlic sage fennel seeds thyme rosemary 1 tablespoon black pepper chile flakes and 2 teaspoons salt. Grind and pound the mixture into a smooth paste. Place the turkey breast skin side down on a clean flat surface. With a sharp knife butterfly the turkey by cutting down the long side of the breast so it can open up like a book to create a large flat rectangle of even thickness. Score the flesh lightly in a cross-hatch pattern being careful not to cut too deeply into the flesh. Season the turkey with salt and black pepper. Rub the herb-spice paste into all the cuts on the surface of the turkey breast. Roll the butterflied breast together tightly starting with the side that does not have skin underneath it (that way there is skin on the outer layers when rolling it up). Form the turkey into a cylinder and secure with butcher¿s twine. Tie the roll every 1 1/2 inches then place in the refrigerator for 4 hours uncovered; this will help the turkey firm up and allows the salt to do a short dry cure on the meat.
            

              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              Remove the turchetta from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature about 30 minutes. Brush the turchetta with olive oil and season with salt and black pepper. In a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat brown the turchetta 2 to 3 minutes per side. Arrange the turchetta skin side up and place the whole pan into the oven and cook until the internal temperature reaches 150 degrees F (carryover cooking will increase the temperature as the turchetta rests) about 1 hour 30 minutes. Remove from the oven place on a large plate tent with foil and rest 15 to 20 minutes. Add the chicken stock to the reserved juices in the pan and stir to combine. Keep warm.
            

              To serve the turchetta remove the string and use a sharp carving knife to slice it into 1-inch-thick medallions. Shingle the slices on a large serving platter spoon cooking juice over the turchetta and serve immediately.

Strawberry Shortcake Cake Recipe | Ree Drummond | Food Network, 9 tablespoons unsalted butter softened plus more for greasing 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour plus more for dusting 3 tablespoons cornstarch 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 3 large eggs 1/2 cup sour cream at room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 pound strawberries plus more to garnish optional 1 1/2 pounds powdered sugar sifted 8 ounces cream cheese at room temperature 2 sticks unsalted butter softened 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Dash salt , Watch how to make this recipe.

Special equipment: an 8-inch cake pan that is at least 2 inches deep! Before baking the batter should not fill the pan more than halfway.

              For the strawberry shortcake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour an 8-inch cake pan.
            

              Sift together the flour cornstarch baking soda and salt. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment cream the butter with 1 1/2 cups of the granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time mixing well after each addition. Add the sour cream and vanilla and mix until combined. Add the sifted dry ingredients and mix on low speed until just barely combined.
            

              Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Bake until no longer jiggly like my bottom 45 to 50 minutes. Remove the cake from the pan as soon as you pull it out of the oven. Place the cake on a cooling rack and allow it to cool completely.
            

              Stem and halve the strawberries and mash then them. Sprinkle the strawberries with the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar and allow to sit for 30 minutes.
            

              For the icing: Combine the powdered sugar cream cheese butter vanilla and dash of salt in a mixing bowl. Mix until very light and fluffy.
            

              Slice the cake in half to make 2 smaller cakes. Spread the strawberries evenly over each cut side of the cake halves pouring on all the juices as well. Place the cake halves into the freezer for 5 minutes just to make icing the cake easier.
            

              Remove the cake halves from the freezer. Use a little less than one-third of the icing to spread over the top of the strawberries on the bottom layer. Place the second cake layer on top. Add half of the remaining icing to the top spreading it evenly. Spread the remaining icing around the sides of the cake.
            

              Leave plain or garnish with strawberry halves. Serve slightly cool.

Crispy Tart with Fresh Fruit Recipe | Food Network, Approximately 2 pounds classic puff pastry recipe follows (or frozen) Pastry cream flavored recipe follows 3/4 cup light corn syrup 1/4 cup water 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate tempered Assorted fresh fruit sliced Confectioners' sugar for dusting 4 cups unbleached flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/4 cup unsalted butter melted and cooled 1/4 cup water 1 1/4 cups butter cold 3 tablespoons light corn syrup 1 tablespoon water 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1/4 cup sugar 2 egg yolks 1 cup whole milk 1/2 vanilla bean 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter optional 2 1/2 cups sugar 2/3 cup light corn syrup 1/2 cup water Cooking spray ,               Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
            

              On a lightly floured work surface roll the puff pastry into a 6 by 12-inch rectangle 1/8-inch thick. Place on a parchment-lined sheet pan and place another sheet pan on top of it. Bake between the 2 sheet pans until it barely begins to take on color about 10 minutes. The puff pastry may rise unevenly in sections. If that happens release the air by gently piercing the dough with the tip of a paring knife. Mix the corn syrup and water together. Remove the puff pastry from the oven and brush the top with the corn syrup mixture. Cover with another sheet of parchment paper and flip over the puff pastry. Peel off the parchment paper that is now on top and brush this side with the corn syrup mixture.
            

              Using a sharp paring knife and a plate as your guide cut about a 10-inch circle from the half-baked puff pastry. Discard the excess dough. I cut the circles when the dough is half-baked so they will keep their shape. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Place the puff pastry circle back in the oven and continue to bake until crispy and golden brown about another 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack until completely cooled.
            

              Using a pastry brush coat one side of each cooled circle with the tempered chocolate and allow the chocolate to set at room temperature about 5 minutes. This layer of chocolate keeps the tarts from getting soggy. When the chocolate has set spread about 2 tablespoons of pastry cream on each tart shell on top the chocolate coating. Cover with assorted sliced fresh fruit. It looks best to arrange the fruit in a sunburst pattern fanning each type of fruit from the center of the circle toward the edge. Sprinkle the tops of the tarts with powdered sugar right before you serve them. A great finish for this dessert is a sugar cage over the top.
            

              Suggested presentation: Sugar cage recipe follows.
            

Classic Puff Pastry:


              For the Classic Puff Pastry: Place the flour salt melted butter and most of the water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed for about 1 minute. Stop the mixer as soon as the ingredients begin to form a dough and pull away from the side of the bowl. If the dough appears too dry and does not come together add the remaining water and mix just until combined. Do not over mix or you will over-develop the gluten. It is very important to keep gluten development to a minimum in this recipe or the finished puff pastry will be tough and chewy instead of delicate and crispy. Remove the dough from the mixer and pat it into a 5-inch square about 2-inches thick. Wrap the dough completely in plastic and let it rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Resting the dough allows the gluten strands that have developed to relax.
            

              Work the cold butter into a square that is about a third smaller than the dough square and about 1-inch thick. Place the butter on a lightly floured work surface and keeping it square shaped use a rolling pin to give it a few quick raps. This will soften the butter. It should be about the same consistency as the puff pastry dough. Lightly flour the butter and rolling pin as needed to keep it from sticking.
            

              Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured work surface. Use the rolling pin to make a mark about 1-inch from each corner of the dough. Roll only this part of each corner away from the center of the dough until it is 1/4-inch thick. The center of the dough should be about 1-inch thick. Place the butter square in the center of the dough square. Pull the rolled-out corners up and over the butter completely enclosing it in a dough package. When the butter has been added the dough is referred to as a paton.
            

              The paton is now ready to be folded. You will need to give the dough six single folds allowing the dough to rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours after every 2 folds. To begin use a rolling pin and roll the paton into a 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Try to keep it an even thickness. Place the dough horizontally in front of you so it will be easier to fold. Fold the dough in thirds by first folding the left end over the middle and then folding the right third over it. Rotate the dough to make sure the seam is on your right. This is known as a single fold or a letter fold because it resembles the way a letter is folded. Repeat the single fold starting with a 10 by 23-inch rectangle placed horizontally in front of you. To show that you have folded the dough two times make two indentations in the dough with your fingertips. At this stage the puff pastry must be kept well wrapped in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours or up to 1 day.
            

              Remove the dough from the refrigerator and give it two more single folds starting each time with a 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Make four indentations in the dough with your fingertips representing the four folds. At this stage the puff pastry must be kept well wrapped in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours or up to 1 day.
            

Pastry Cream:


              For the Pastry Cream: Sift together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add the egg yolks and whisk until well combined. Pour the milk and the remaining 1/4-cup sugar into a 2-quart saucepan and place the saucepan over medium-high heat. While the milk is heating use a sharp knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside of the bean. Add the seeds and the skin to the heating milk and bring to a boil.
            

              Temper the egg mixture with the hot milk by carefully pouring about half of the milk into the egg mixture. Immediately whisk to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Pour the tempered egg mixture into the saucepan and continue to whisk. Continuously whisk to ensure that the mixture cooks evenly. Once the pastry cream has come to a boil continue to whisk and cook for another 2 minutes to fully develop the flavor of the pastry cream and to cook out the flavor of the starch. Remove the pan from the heat. Strain the pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any pieces of cooked egg and the vanilla bean.
            

              If you would like to add butter this is the time to add it. Cut the butter into small chunks and stir it in until it is well incorporated. Pour the pastry cream into a clean airtight container and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool at room temperature then store in the refrigerator for up to 2 to 3 days until ready to use
            

              Flavor the cream according to your taste. For example with a whisk or spatula slowly fold about 1 tablespoon of any flavored liqueur into the cream at any point in the recipe tasting often. If you add too much the cream will become runny and lose its shape. If you prefer to add flavor without alcohol place the zest of 1 orange in the heating milk to infuse the flavor into the pastry cream. Store the pastry cream well wrapped in the refrigerator until ready to use.
            

Sugar Cage:


              Place the sugar corn syrup and water in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook the sugar mixture until it reaches 311 degrees F or what is known as the "hard crack" stage. Remove from the heat and carefully pour into a medium-sized microwave-able glass bowl.
            

              Wash dry and lightly but thoroughly coat with cooking spray a clean dry bowl that matches the diameter of whatever you're placing the sugar cage over. Dip the tines of a fork into the hot sugar. Carefully but quickly wave the fork over the inside of the bowl allowing the sugar to drip off the fork in long thin strands. Try to distribute the strands evenly on the sides and bottom of the bowl making sure to come all the way to the rim however not so thick that you can't see the bowl through the sugar.
            

              Using a sharp chef's knife slice the edge of the cage clean by scraping the blade of the knife along the rim of the bowl. Set aside to cool about 5 minutes.
            

              To unmold the cage place your thumbs on the outside of the bowl and your fingers on the inside of the sugar cage. Gently pull the cage loose from the side and bottom of the bowl; you will be able to see the cage release from the inside of the bowl. You will need to apply this gentle pressure all around the inside of the bowl. Once the cage has released from the bowl carefully lift it out and place it over the dessert. If the sugar is still too warm the cage may begin to collapse. A good idea is to release the cage from the bowl but leave it in the bowl until it has cooled completely. This will ensure that it keeps its shape. (At this stage the cage can be stored right side up in an airtight container in a cool dry place for one to two days.)
            

              How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):
            

              Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper.
            

              One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate's residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually chocolate begins to set or crystallize along the side of the bowl. As it sets mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.
            

              Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this or a whisk.
            

              The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work requires a lot of room and makes a big mess.
            

              A simple method of checking tempering is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.

              Tips on Sterilizing Jars Properly-handled sterilized equipment will keep canned foods in good condition for years. Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods.
            

              Sterilizing Tips: Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks. Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass plastic or metal lid which has a rubber seal. Two piece lids are best for canning as they vacuum seal when processed. To sterilize jars before filling with jams pickles or preserves wash jars and lids with hot soapy water. Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up without touching on a tray. Boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan covered with water for 15 minutes. Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars to move them from boiling water. Be sure the tongs are sterilized too by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes. As a rule hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars. All items used in the process of making jams jellies and preserves must be clean. This includes any towels used and especially your hands. After the jars are sterilized you can preserve the food. It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products.

Chocolate Butterscotch Caramel Bars:


              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick spray.
            

              Mix together the flour oats brown sugar baking powder and salt in a bowl. Cut in the butter with a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle the mixture into the prepared pan and pat lightly to pack it slightly.
            

              Bake until light golden brown on top and done in the middle watching to make sure it doesn't burn 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool for 15 minutes.
            

              Spoon the dulce de leche into a microwave-safe bowl and microwave to just slightly soften it about 45 seconds. Scoop it on top of the oatmeal base and use an offset spatula to spread it out to the edges and into an even layer. Sprinkle on a layer of peanuts so that they completely cover the caramel and use your hands to gently press them into the caramel. Sprinkle on the butterscotch chips and mini chocolate chips in generous layers.
            

              Note: The warmth of the cookie base and caramel should slightly soften the butterscotch and chocolate chips. When that happens use your hands to very gently press the chips just enough to anchor them together (but not enough to misshape them). If the pan isn't warm enough pop it into the oven for 30 seconds or so and gently press the chips to anchor them together.
            

              Chill the bars for 2 to 3 hours to make them easy to slice. Remove them from the pan place on a cutting board and use a long serrated knife to cut into small squares (they're rich!). Serve cold or at room temperature.

              Rinse the turkey and pat it dry with paper towels. Place the turkey on a rack set inside a large roasting pan. Place the orange and lemon wedges onion and 2 sprigs of each fresh herb in the main turkey cavity. Tie the legs together to hold the shape of the turkey. Stir 2 tablespoons of butter the herbes de Provence oil and 1 1/2 teaspoons of each the salt and pepper in a small saucepan over medium heat just until the butter melts. Rub the butter mixture all over the turkey and between the turkey breast meat and skin. Place the turkey neck and giblets in roasting pan. (Recipe can be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before roasting.)

Spoon off the fat from atop the pan juices. Add enough chicken broth about 1 to 2 cups to the pan juices to measure 4 cups total. Melt the remaining butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the flour and whisk for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the broth. Simmer until the gravy thickens slightly whisking often about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve the turkey with the gravy.

Crisp Duck with Whipped Taro Root and Taro Chips Recipe | Food Network, 2 4- pound Long Island ducks 3 tablespoons ginger 6 cloves of garlic 1 quart Kikkoman soy sauce 1 cup of sherry 2 tablespoons of sesame oil 1 1/2 cup julienned scallions or more Whipped Taro Root and Taro Chips recipe follows Duck Jus recipe follows 2 pounds of taro root 6 tablespoons unsalted butter Salt and pepper to taste 2 cups of peanut or grapeseed oil 2 tablespoons oil One chopped roasted duck body 1 leek roughly chopped 1 stalk celery 1/2 a carrot cut into half-inch pieces 1 cup white wine 2 cups chicken stock 1/2 cup soy marinade ,               Separate legs from the breast by cutting where the breast and carcass end and legs begin or have your butcher cut it for you. Using a sharp boning knife follow right along the breast bone on either side and remove both breasts. Trim fat along outside of the breast allowing approximately one third of an inch of fat overlap. Score fat on breast by making a diagonal cut making sure not to cut the breast meat. About four strokes is sufficient.
            

              In a food processor dice unpeeled ginger and garlic until coarsely chopped. Place in a stainless steel bowl. Add remaining ingredients. Place the two whole duck legs and the four duck breasts in the marinade. Remove the duck breasts after one hour. The legs should continue to marinate for an additional half an hour and then be removed.
            

              Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
            

              Using the carcasses of the duck place the duck legs on the duck carcass. Place legs and carcasses in a roasting pan and roast for 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours. Check periodically to make sure the ducks are not getting too dark. They are ready when the leg wiggles freely to your touch and they are a nice deep amber color. The skin should look crisp and rendered of fat. Cool. Once cooled take your boning knife and cut through the skin right in the middle of the legs. Using your hands separate duck legs. (Use your thumb to get under the oyster and gently pull leg from the bones.) Gently use your fingers to pull out the thigh bone. Trim legs a little to keep a nice triangular shape.
            

              For the breasts:
            

              Heat a large 12 inch sautepan to medium high. (You can cook two duck breasts in one pan or cook one at a time in a smaller 10 inch pan.) Add two breasts skin side down to start rendering the fat. Cook over medium high heat for a couple of minutes. (You will need to remove the rendered fat as you go. Hold duck breast still with a pair of tongs and pour fat into a stainless bowl or other container. Return to heat). After the first couple of minutes on medium high heat turn burner down to medium so not to burn the duck. The duck should be a rich amber color. Continue cooking until the fat is almost completely rendered. You can check this by looking at the incisions of the fat. When there is only a thin crisp skin the duck is ready to be flipped. Turn duck over. Shut heat off and leave the breast to sit in the pan for about three to four minutes. Remove from pan and allow to rest for five minutes.
            

              Meanwhile place the duck legs in a medium to medium small saute pan skin side down and pan covered to heat and finish any additional rendering of fat approximately five minutes.
            

              Slice duck breast into fairly thing slices keeping the nice shape of the breast. With a spatula pick up breast and fan it out onto the plate. Place duck legs on an angle near the top of the slices. Serve with Whipped Taro Root Taro Chips lots of julienned scallions and a little Duck Jus.
            

WHIPPED TARO ROOT AND TARO CHIPS:


              Peel taro root. First for the chips take your peeler and peel approximately one cup of long taro shreds. Reserve for frying.

Strain into a colander reserving cup of the liquid. In a food processor pulse taro adding little dabs of butter as you go along with some of the cooking liquid to make a smooth consistency. Remove and season with salt and pepper.
            

              For the chips:
            

              Heat a couple of cups of peanut or grapeseed oil to 350 degrees. Drops shreds into oil in small batches. Remove when crisp (the chips should still be light in color) and salt.

Pancetta:


              Ask your butcher for a 5 pound nice square piece of pork belly (skinless) that will fit into a 2-gallon zip-top bag.
            

              Pat the belly with paper towels to dry. Mix together all the spices. Wearing plastic gloves rub the cure mixture into both sides of the belly. Place in a 2-gallon zip-top bag put on a sheet pan and refrigerate. Every day for 1 week turn the bag over and massage the belly (through the bag) to ensure saturation. The pork will take on a slightly darker color than what it was. This is a sign that the cure is working. It will also draw some moisture out of the belly. When the meat is darker and firmer remove the belly from the bag and run under water to remove any cure sediment. Pat dry and lightly cover with a dusting of ground white pepper. Roll the belly very tightly into a log and wrap tightly with cheesecloth.

Add the chopped onions and 1 teaspoon of the pepper. Cook the onion down a little 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chopped cabbage sauerkraut remaining 1 teaspoon pepper and 1 teaspoon salt. Let the mixture cook 10 to 15 minutes depending on how done you like the cabbage. Strain and let cool.
            

              For the dough: Put the yeast and sugar in a 4-cup measuring cup and add warm water to the 1-cup mark. Stir together and let sit until the yeast rises to twice its original size. Put the powdered milk in another 4-cup measuring cup and add water to the 2-cup mark. Stir together. In a large mixing bowl add the flour salt and shortening. Cut the shortening into the flour by hand. Next make a well in the flour and add the eggs yeast mixture and the powdered milk mixture to the flour. Work it all together until the dough comes away from the bowl (you may need a touch more flour or water). Oil the dough slightly on each side cover and let rise for 10 minutes. Pinch and let rise another 15 minutes.

              Lightly flour a work surface and put the dough on the flour. Begin to roll the dough as close to a rectangle as you can roughly 24-by-30 inches. Once the dough is rolled out cut the dough into squares roughly 6-by-6 inches. Take a square of dough and roll it out a little bigger roughly 8-by-8 inches. Turn the re-rolled square over and add a full cup of filling mixture into the middle of the dough. Bring the opposite corners of the square together and then bring the other 2 opposite corners together. You should have all 4 corners drawn together. Pinch down the 4 seams of the dough. Once you pinch all the seams push down slightly on the kraut burger. This will release extra air and help you find any place you missed sealing the kraut burger. Turn the sealed pocket over and place it on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes.

Roast Pork Loin with Applesauce Recipe | Food Network Kitchen | Food Network, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil such as soy corn or peanut One 3-pound boneless center cut pork loin trimmed and tied Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 medium onion sliced 1 carrot sliced 1 stalk celery sliced 3 cloves garlic smashed 3 sprigs fresh sage 3 sprigs fresh thyme 1/2 cup dry white wine 1 cup chicken broth homemade or low-sodium canned 1 to 2 tablespoons whole grain mustard 1 to 2 tablespoons unsalted butter diced and chilled About 4 cups applesauce recipe follows 2 1/2 pounds tart red skinned apples such as McIntosh 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice ,               Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              In a large ovenproof skillet heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Season the pork loin all over generously with salt and pepper. Lay the loin fat side down in the skillet and cook until golden brown about 2 minutes. Use tongs to turn the meat and continue to brown it on all sides about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the meat to a plate and set it aside.
            

              Add the onion carrot celery garlic and herb sprigs to the skillet. Cook stirring frequently until the vegetables are softened about 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the wine. Return the skillet to a high heat and scrape the bottom with a wooden spoon to loosen up any browned bits. Boil the wine until it is reduced by about half. Add the broth and bring to a boil.
            

              Return the loin and any collected juices to the skillet. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the loin until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers between 145 to 150 degrees F. about 40 minutes. (See Cooks Note.)
            

              Transfer the pork to a plate and cover it loosely with foil. Set it aside in a warm spot while you make a sauce.
            

              Strain the cooking liquid through a fine mesh strainer into a small saucepan; press down on the vegetables with a wooden spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids. Boil the liquid over high heat until reduced by about a third. Reduce the heat to medium-low whisk in the mustard and then the bits of butter to enrich the sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm but do not boil.
            

              Remove the strings from the roast and then slice the loin. Add any collected juices to the sauce. Arrange the meat on a warm platter and season with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce over the meat. Serve with the applesauce on the side.
            

              Cooks Note: Pork cooked this way will be slightly pink. If desired cook the pork to 160 degrees F. but be aware that this lean cut will not be as moist at the higher temperature.
            

Applesauce:


              Remove the apple's stems. Coarsely chop the apples with their skin and seeds. Combine the apples sugar and lemon juice with 3 tablespoons of water in a large saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Cover and lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook until the apples are completely soft about 20 minutes.
            

              Remove the lid and continue to cook (stir frequently to prevent scorching) until most of the liquid has evaporated about 10 minutes more. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Pass the apple mixture through a food mill; discard the peels and seeds. Serve warm or at room temperature. Refrigerate if not using immediately.

Butternut Squash Tortellini with Brown Butter Sauce Recipe | Giada De Laurentiis | Food Network, 1 butternut squash approximately 2 pounds cubed (about 3 cups) 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil plus 2 tablespoons 1 1/2 teaspoon herbs de Provence 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt plus more to taste 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper plus more to taste 2 large shallots chopped (about 1/2 cup) 2 garlic cloves chopped 1 cup whole milk ricotta cheese 4 small amaretti cookies crushed (about 1/3 cup) 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 package small wonton wrappers 3/4 cup butter (1 1/2 sticks) 2 tablespoons torn fresh sage leaves 1/2 cup toasted walnuts chopped 1/2 cup dried cranberries or chopped dried cherries or mixture of both 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt plus more to taste 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper plus more to taste 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese , Watch how to make this recipe.


              To make the tortellini preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a foil-lined baking sheet toss together the butternut squash 2 tablespoons of olive oil herbs de Provence salt and pepper. Bake in the oven until soft and golden about 25 minutes. Meanwhile heat the olive oil in a small saute pan over medium heat. Cook the shallots and garlic until lightly golden about 3 minutes.
            

              In a food processor combine the butternut squash mixture the shallot mixture and the ricotta cheese and pulse a few times to blend. Add the crushed amaretti cookies the nutmeg and sprinkle with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pulse until smooth. The tortellini filling can be made one day ahead.
            

              To make the tortellini lay out 6 wonton skins keeping the remaining skins inside the package or under a very lightly dampened paper towel. Place 1 tablespoon of squash mixture in the middle of each skin. Dip a pastry brush in a little water and wet the edges of the skin. Gently fold the square wrapper into a triangle making sure the edges are securely closed and there are no air pockets inside. Dampen the two bottom corners of the longest side of the triangle and gently bring them together pressing lightly to secure. Place the formed tortellini on a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Before laying out another 6 wonton sheets be careful to dry the work surface. This will help keep tortellini from sticking to the baking sheet. Continue until all the butternut squash mixture is used. There should be approximately 36 tortellini. (The tortellini can be formed frozen on the baking sheet transferred to a tightly sealed plastic bag or container and stored for up to six months. To cook simply toss the frozen ravioli into the salted boiling water and cook for 4 minutes.)
            

              To make the sauce and serve bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile melt the butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat.
            

              Add the sage walnuts and cranberries and let cook until the butter starts to brown about 3 minutes. Turn the heat off and season with salt and pepper.
            

              Stir to combine. Then gently place the tortellini in the boiling water and gently stir. When they begin to float they are done about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon gently spoon the tortellini onto a serving platter Top with the brown butter sauce sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve.

Baklava Recipe | Tyler Florence | Food Network, 1 pound shelled walnuts toasted 1/2 pound blanched almonds toasted 1/2 pound shelled pistachios toasted 2/3 cup brown sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 1 pound unsalted butter melted 1 pound phyllo pastry sheets 2 cups sugar 2 cups water 1/2 cup orange blossom honey 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 lemon juiced 2 large strips orange peel 1 cinnamon stick 3 whole cloves ,               Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              Finely chop the nuts in a food processor or coffee grinder. Transfer nuts to a bowl and mix in brown sugar ground cinnamon and cloves.
            

              Brush a 13 by 9-inch baking pan with melted butter and set aside. Cut a piece of cardboard into a 13 by 9-inch rectangle. Unroll the phyllo dough and lay the sheets flat on a work surface. Set the cardboard template on the stack of phyllo and trim the excess so they fit the pan. Keep the pastry covered with a damp not wet towel as you work to prevent drying out.
            

              To build the baklava you will alternate 3 layers of dough with 2 layers of nuts. Start with a stable base of 8 sheets on the bottom brushing each with melted butter. Spread 1/2 the nut mixture evenly over the stacked sheets. Cover with 4 sheets of phyllo painting each with melted butter then sprinkle again with remaining nut mixture. Top the last layer of nuts with 8 layers of phyllo as you did for the bottom. Drizzle any remaining butter over top.
            

              If you have time cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes so the butter will set and make the baklava easier to cut. Using a sharp knife make 5 cuts across lengthwise then cut diagonally to form diamonds. Baklava is more difficult to cut after it is cooked because the pastry becomes so flaky. Bake for about 40 minutes until golden and flaky. If the top browns too quickly during baking tent with foil.

Pea Whipped Potatoes Recipe | Michael Chiarello | Food Network, 2 pounds russet potatoes peeled and cut into large chunks 1 1/2 pounds English peas or 2 pounds frozen peas 2 cups heavy cream 1/2 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter at room temperature 1 tablespoon minced garlic (about 3 to 4 cloves) Salt and freshly ground black pepper Grated Parmesan optional , Watch how to make this recipe.


              Put the potatoes in a large saucepan with cold water to cover by 3 inches. Salt the water cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until tender about 10 minutes. While the potatoes are cooking cook the peas in a separate saucepan of salted water. Simmer until just tender about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a sieve and cool on a baking sheet. When the potatoes are done drain well scatter on a baking sheet and let cool for several minutes. In a small saucepan heat 1/2 cup of the cream until it reaches a boil then simmer for a few minutes. Add the cream to a blender with the cooked peas and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.

String Bean and Potato Salad Recipe | Anne Burrell | Food Network, 2 pounds red bliss potatoes 2 cloves garlic Kosher salt 1/4 to 1/3 cup sherry vinegar 1/4 to 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 pound haricots verts stem ends removed 1/2 cup pitted and slivered gaeta or kalamata olives 1/2 bunch fresh oregano leaves finely chopped 3 scallions thinly sliced on the bias Pinch of red pepper flakes ,               Put the potatoes and garlic in a pot and cover with well-salted water. Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender about 20 minutes; drain. When they are cool enough to handle but still hot carefully cut the potatoes in half (try not to pull off the skins) and transfer to a large bowl. Finely chop the garlic and add it to the potatoes along with 2 tablespoons each vinegar and olive oil; season with salt. (It is important to do this while the potatoes are still warm so they absorb the vinegar and oil and are seasoned all the way through.)
            

              Meanwhile bring another pot of well-salted water to a boil over medium heat. Set up a bowl of ice water and season it generously with salt. Add the haricots verts to the boiling water and cook until tender 5 to 6 minutes (bite a bean to be sure they are properly cooked); drain and immediately put in the ice water to "shock" them or stop the cooking. When they are cold drain the haricots verts and let them dry a little. Cut them in half.
            

              Add the haricots verts olives oregano scallions and red pepper flakes to the bowl with the potatoes. Stir to combine well; taste and adjust the seasoning. Add the remaining oil and vinegar if needed. This salad is good now but it will be even better if you let it sit for at least 1 hour at room temperature.

Turkey Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes Recipe | Food Network Kitchen | Food Network, 1 head garlic Nonstick cooking spray 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium onion chopped 2 ribs celery chopped 1 apple peeled cored and chopped 2 pounds ground turkey breast 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 cup cornbread stuffing cubes 1 cup low-fat plain yogurt 2 egg whites 1 tablespoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes whole with skin scrubbed *see Cook's note 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2/3 cup buttermilk at room temperature Freshly ground white pepper Orange segments from 2 large oranges 1 cup whole cranberry sauce 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 1/8 teaspoon cayenne ,               To make the meatloaf: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              Spray the ring mold pan with the nonstick cooking spray set aside. Slice off the top 1/3 of the head of garlic. Place on a piece of aluminum foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Place in the oven and roast for 45 minutes.
            

              While the garlic is in the oven start the meatloaf: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions celery and apples cook until softened about 5 minutes stirring occasionally. Transfer the vegetables to a large bowl. Add the remaining meatloaf ingredients and mix well. Place the meatloaf mixture in the prepared ring mold. Bake until cooked through about 30 minutes.
            

              Meanwhile: make the mashed potatoes: In a large saucepan cover the potatoes with cold water and add 1 teaspoon of the salt. Bring to a boil over high heat then lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook until fork tender about 30 to 60 minutes depending upon the size of the potatoes. We've found that boiling the potatoes whole with the skin on gives the potatoes more potato flavor.
            

              Halve the potatoes crosswise. Put the halves in a ricer cut-side down and press the potato through the ricer into a bowl. The flesh should easily pass through the holes and the skins remain in the ricer. Discard the skin and repeat with the remaining potatoes. (Alternatively peel the cooked potatoes and put through a food mill or mash with a hand-held potato masher.) Immediately add the buttermilk and roasted garlic to taste and combine well. Season with the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper to taste.
            

              When the meatloaf is done turn on the broiler. Invert the ring mold onto an ovenproof platter or if a baking sheet was used carefully transfer meatloaf to the platter using a large spatula. Using a spatula cover the meatloaf on all sides with mashed potatoes as if frosting a cake. If using a pastry bag add decorative swirls to the top. Place the platter under the broiler until potatoes are nicely browned about 12 minutes.
            

              To make the chutney: Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl.
            

              Special Equipment: large ring mold pan pastry bag and tip (optional) .
            

              *Cooks Note: Yukon gold potatoes have a great buttery appearance when mashed which is a great way to fool the eye when cooking and eating lower fat foods.

              For the apple butter sauce:Melt butter in a saute pan and add apples cooking over medium heat for a few minutes until they begin to soften. Add apple juice orange juice and rice wine vinegar cover and allow the apples to cook until very soft. Then uncover and allow liquid to reduce to about 1/3 of what you started with. Puree in a blender or food processor. Create a slurry by gradually whisking cornstarch into about 1/4 cup water and blend the slurry into the sauce. Return the sauce to the pot and allow to cook for a few minutes to thicken. Season with salt if needed.
            

              Begin the creamed leeks while the apples are cooking.
            

              Heat the olive oil and butter in a medium saute pan over medium heat and saute onion until translucent. Deglaze the pan with wine and reduce until the liquid is almost all gone. (While you are waiting for the wine to reduce start cooking the leeks.) Cook the leeks in simmering water until tender. Drain and set aside. When the wine has mostly evaporated stir in the cream season with salt and pepper and lower heat to a simmer to allow to reduce and thicken. Strain this sauce and pour over the leeks and set aside briefly in a warm place.
            

              For the fish:Season the salmon fillets with coarse sea salt and both peppers. Place a little oil into the saute pan and bring to smoking point (you need a hot pan in order to get a crispy outside). Cook the salmon skin side down leaving undisturbed (no peeking) for about 5 minutes or until the skin begins to get crispy then turn and begin cooking for 4 minutes more. This allows the surface of the fish to "caramelize." (You may need more time on the salmon depending on the thickness). You can if you wish finish the salmon in a preheated 350 degree F oven. However DO NOT OVERCOOK THE SALMON. Once you touch the flesh and it springs back up it's cooked. Remember because of carryover cooking the fish will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven.
            

              Reheat the apple butter sauce if necessary. Place 4 lengths of the creamed leeks on one side the serving plate with a salmon fillet on the other. Spoon apple butter sauce on the fish and garnish with lemon thyme.

Balsamic-Caramel Sauce over Vanilla Ice Cream Recipe | Michael Chiarello | Food Network, 1 cup heavy cream 1 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons water plus more for brushing 4 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 lemon juiced 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 quarts vanilla ice cream ,               Bring cream just to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and keep the cream warm.
            

              In a large high-sided saucepan over medium-high heat dissolve the sugar with 2 tablespoons of water. As the sugar mixture begins to bubble watch for crystals developing on the inside of the pan just above the liquid. Using a pastry brush dipped in water brush the inside of the pan right above the crystals so the water drips down and dissolves the crystals back into the liquid. When the sugar begins to brown occasionally move the pan to swirl the liquid gently and cook it evenly. Continue to cook until the mixture is dark golden brown. The total cooking time will be 8 to 9 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.
            

              Very carefully add the hot cream to the sugar mixture a few tablespoons at a time. The liquid will bubble up dramatically. Stir the sauce and cook for 1 minute. Add the vinegar lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt mix well. Pour into a heatproof bowl. You should have about 1 1/4 cups of sauce. The sauce can be made several weeks ahead covered with plastic and stored either at room temperature or in the refrigerator. If refrigerated warm in a microwave oven before using.

Gingerbread Cookies Recipe | Duff Goldman | Food Network, 2 cups all-purpose flour plus more for flouring the surface 2 teaspoons ground ginger 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter softened 1/3 cup lightly packed dark brown sugar 1/3 cup molasses 1 extra-large egg Nonstick cooking spray for spraying the parchment paper 4 cups powdered sugar (approximately) 3 extra-large egg whites (pasteurized) 3 drops lemon juice plus more if needed Food coloring optional , Watch how to make this recipe.


              For the cookies: In a medium bowl combine the flour ginger cinnamon nutmeg baking soda cloves and salt.
            

              In a big bowl beat the butter and brown sugar together with a wooden spoon or a hand mixer. Mix in the molasses and egg until smooth then add the flour mixture and mix until well combined. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.
            

              On a floured surface roll out the dough to about 1/8-inch thickness. Freeze it flat on a baking sheet for 20 to 30 minutes.
            

              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Lightly spray the paper with cooking spray.
            

              Use your preferred cookie cutters to stamp out shapes (or use a paring knife and architect the gingerbread home of your dreams) then transfer the shapes to the prepared baking sheets. Bake until the dough no longer looks shiny 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool on the sheets for 10 minutes then transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
            

              For the royal icing: Using a stand mixer and the whisk attachment whip most of the powdered sugar with the egg whites and most of the lemon juice. Whip until the icing holds its shape and is bright white (not translucent) 5 to 8 minutes. If it is too soft add more powdered sugar. If it is too stiff add a bit more lemon juice drop by drop. If you are using color add a few drops of it at this point and keep whipping until you have a shade you want. Pipe the royal icing onto the cooled cookies to decorate.
            

              To store royal icing: The ideal way is to scrape it out of the bowl and into a plastic disposable piping bag then leave it at room temperature. Don't cut the bag until you're ready to use the royal icing and don't overfill the bag--you want enough room to tie the back of the bag off to keep the icing airtight. If any air comes into contact with the icing it gets hard and that part of the icing is useless. Never attempt to mix hard bits back into the royal icing--you'll ruin the whole batch. The other accepted method of storing the icing is to scrape it into a plastic or ceramic bowl and cover it with a wet paper towel. This method works but it wastes both paper towels and royal icing. It's also just annoying. When you're piping small designs you want to use very small parchment piping bags. It's easy to stick the nose of a large piping bag into a small one and extract exactly how much you need. When the icing is in a bowl you have to use a spoon to get it out. The spoon is difficult to get into a piping bag and you keep using spoons and wasting royal icing.

Peanut Butter Pie Recipe | Food Network, 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons granulated sugar 3/4 teaspoon table salt 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter cut into small cubes 1/4 cup shortening 7 to 8 tablespoons ice water 1/2 cup chunky peanut butter 8 ounces confectioners' sugar 4 tablespoons confectioners' sugar 2 cups heavy cream chilled 2 cups milk 1/2 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggsplus 3 large egg yolks 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon salt 4 teaspoons cornstarch 4 tablespoons unsalted butter ,               For the crust: Mix together the flour granulated sugar and salt in a large bowl until well combined. Using clean hands add the butter and toss until just coated. Work the butter into the flour until the mixture is in clumps the size of quarters about 2 minutes. The butter clumps should go from small chunks to larger chunks. Add the shortening toss until just coated in flour then rub it into the flour mixture until the mixture forms pea-size pieces (some big chunks should remain) and comes together in fist-sized clumps when squeezed about 1 minute. Drizzle in half the ice water and rake through the mixture with your fingers until just moistened. Drizzle in the remaining water 1 tablespoon at a time and comb through the mixture with our fingers to moisten. The mixture will eventually come together; the dough is moist enough when it is moistened through but is not wet when pressed. (Do not overwork the dough or it will become tough.)
            

              While rotating the bowl with one hand use the palm of your other hand to push the dough along the side of the bowl to gather it into a ball. Turn the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap press it into a flat disk and close in the wrap. Place in the coldest part of the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
            

              Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out the dough and form a crust. Press it into a 9- or 10-inch pie pan and bake until golden brown 10 minutes. Remove and let cool.
            

              For the peanut butter crumble: Mix the peanut butter and confectioners' sugar with a spoon or stand mixer over low speed until it is a crumble consistency. Set aside.
            

              For the whipped cream: Add the confectioners' sugar to the cream and whip at high speed with a stand mixer until fluffy.
            

              For the pudding: Whisk together the milk granulated sugar and 2 eggs in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Mix the 3 egg yolks with the vanilla salt and cornstarch in a small bowl. Slowly stir the egg yolk mixture into the milk mixture until it firms up. Stir in the butter until combined. Remove from the heat and set aside. If everything else is done place the mixture in the refrigerator for a few minutes to cool.
            

              To assemble the pie: Layer about one-third of the peanut butter crumble in the bottom of the pie crust followed by half of the cooled pudding and half of the whipped cream. Repeat this process again and top with the crumble. Keep the pie in the refrigerator until ready to serve.

Blend until smooth. Reserve.
            

              Pierce the soft eye of the coconut and drain the coconut water. Reserve.
            

              Crack coconut in 1/2 using the back of a cleaver.
            

              Separate the coconut meat from the shell. Use a pairing knife to remove the brown skin from the meat. Using the finest part of your grater grate 2 cups of coconut .
            

              Pour coconut water in a measuring cup and if necessary top off with beer until you have 3/4 cup of liquid. Reserve. If you are using store-bought shredded coconut (and consequently do not have any coconut water) replace mixture with 3/4 cup of beer.
            

              In a large bowl combine flour coconut water/beer mixture baking soda salt cayenne and egg. Beat until it is smooth. Add a bit more flour or beer if necessary so that the batter has the consistency of thick pancake batter.
            

              Tightly wrap each shrimp like a pinwheel (with the tail end of the shrimp on the outside) and skewer 1 shrimp on the end of each skewer. Use a paper towel to pat the shrimp dry.
            

              Pour oil into a small tall pot until it is 3 inches deep. Heat oil until it reaches 350 degrees F (see oil dissertation below).
            

              While oil is heating dip each shrimp into the batter then dredge into the coconut shreds so that the entire "lollypop" is covered in coconut shreds.
            

              When oil is ready submerge 4 shrimp at a time into oil (with the skewers sticking out of the pot). Fry for approximately 1 minute or until coconut is a golden brown rotating the top of the skewer once or twice. Remove and place lollypops on paper towel to absorb excess oil.
            

              Skim any wayward coconut shreds from the oil. Adjust heat so that it is 350 degrees F again and continue with next batch. Serve with apricot dipping sauce. For a creative presentation stick skewers into an upturned pineapple or melon 1/2 and/or serve the dip in a coconut 1/2 (the side without the hole!)

Pea Whipped Potatoes Recipe | Michael Chiarello | Food Network, 2 pounds russet potatoes peeled and cut into large chunks 1 1/2 pounds English peas or 2 pounds frozen peas 2 cups heavy cream 1/2 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter at room temperature 1 tablespoon minced garlic (about 3 to 4 cloves) Salt and freshly ground black pepper Grated Parmesan optional , Watch how to make this recipe.


              Put the potatoes in a large saucepan with cold water to cover by 3 inches. Salt the water cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until tender about 10 minutes. While the potatoes are cooking cook the peas in a separate saucepan of salted water. Simmer until just tender about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a sieve and cool on a baking sheet. When the potatoes are done drain well scatter on a baking sheet and let cool for several minutes. In a small saucepan heat 1/2 cup of the cream until it reaches a boil then simmer for a few minutes. Add the cream to a blender with the cooked peas and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
            

              Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until the butter stops foaming and turns a light brown. Add the garlic and cook quickly until pale gold. Add remaining cream season to taste with salt and pepper and bring to a boil.
            

              Press the cooled potatoes through a ricer or food mill into the butter and garlic mixture tossing to coat.
            

              Reduce the heat to low. Add the remaining butter by tablespoonfuls stirring vigorously after each addition. In this way the butter does not melt into a golden puddle. Instead it forms an emulsion with the potatoes creating a very smooth puree.
            

              Fold the pea puree into the mashed potatoes and adjust seasoning as necessary. Instead of salt the puree can be seasoned with a little grated Parmesan if desired.

Masters Marinated Salmon Recipe | Robert Irvine | Food Network, 1 mango peeled and sliced away from the seed 3 to 4 stalks fresh lemongrass tough outer leaves removed and main yellowish stalk bruised with the side of a knife and cut into manageable lengths (about 2 inches) 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro stems removed 3 scallions white and tender green parts only 1 shallot peeled and quartered 1-inch piece fresh ginger root skin scraped off with the tip of a spoon and quartered 1 tablespoon green curry paste 1/4 cup Irvine Spices "Roland" Sriracha Chili Sauce or sambal oelek (chili sauce) 1/2 cup dry Chardonnay 1/4 cup soy sauce 1/2 cup orange juice 1/2 cup coconut milk 2 tablespoons olive oil 6 (8-ounce) portions of salmon ,               For the marinade: Add 1 at a time through the feed opening of a running blender the mango tender parts of lemongrass cilantro scallions shallot and ginger root until they begin to form a paste. Leave the blender running and through the feed opening add the curry paste and sriracha chili sauce and blend together for a few seconds then continue by adding the liquids 1 at a time: Chardonnay soy sauce orange juice and coconut milk. Reserve half of this mixture in a small bowl to make into a sauce.
            

              Arrange the salmon in a shallow bowl and pour the other half of the mixture over the fish. Cover and let marinate refrigerated for at least 2 hours.
            

              Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              Transfer the reserved sauce mixture to a small saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until it begins to bubble and thicken.
            

              Heat the olive oil in an oven-safe skillet and sear each side of the salmon (skin side down first) without disturbing for the first 3 to 4 minutes of sear time on each side. (This allows the surface to caramelize so the fish won't tear apart when you flip it.) Transfer the pan to the oven to finish the fish - a further 5 to 7 minutes depending upon the thickness of the fillets. Do not overcook the fish. It is done when it springs back upon being lightly prodded. Use an oven mitt to remove the pan from the oven (that handle will be hot). Transfer salmon to a platter and let rest.
            

              Strain the sauce and spoon over the salmon fillets.

Savannah Bow Ties Recipe | Paula Deen | Food Network, 1/2 a (17 1/4-ounce) package frozen puff pastry (1 sheet) 1/2 cup almond paste 1 egg yolk white reserved 1/4 cup packed brown sugar 2 teaspoons milk 1 egg white Sugar for sprinkling Chocolate Dipping Sauce recipe follows 3/4 cup sugar 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon salt 6 (1.5-ounce) milk chocolate bars 2 cups whipping cream 1 egg yolk beaten 1/2 teaspoon vanilla ,               Let pastry stand at room temperature for 20 minutes or until easy to roll. Unfold pastry on a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 14-inch square. Cut square in half with a fluted pastry wheel.
            

              Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
            

              For filling: crumble almond paste in a small mixing bowl. Add egg yolk brown sugar and milk. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well mixed. Spread filling over 1 pastry half *. Place remaining pastry half on top of filling. Using the fluted pastry wheel cut dough crosswise into fourteen 1-inch-wide strips. Then cut each strip in half crosswise to make 28 pieces. Twist each piece twice. Place twists about 2 inches apart on cookie sheets lined with foil or parchment paper. Brush twists with slightly beaten egg white. Sprinkle with sugar (coarse sugar if available).
            

              Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden. Transfer to wire racks to cool. Serve with Chocolate Dipping Sauce.
            

              *Almond filling will be very stiff. To make spreading easier drop a dollop of filling uniformly over pastry. Spray a piece of waxed paper with non-stick cooking spray. Press almond paste evenly over entire dough. Spray waxed paper as often as necessary to prevent filling from sticking.
            

Chocolate Dipping Sauce:

Killer Turkey Burgers Recipe | Anne Burrell | Food Network, Extra-virgin olive oil for coating the pan 1 onion cut into 1/4-inch dice Kosher salt 2 cloves garlic smashed and finely chopped 1 1/2 pounds ground turkey One 8-ounce can water chestnuts coarsely chopped (not too fine--they add GREAT texture) 1/4 cup soy sauce plus more if needed 1/2 bunch of fresh cilantro leaves finely chopped 1-inch piece of fresh ginger peeled and grated 2 tablespoons sambal oelek or Asian chili paste optional (but recommended) 1/2 cup mayonnaise 2 teaspoons sambal oelek 4 burger buns (I like the seeded ones) 4 slices American of Cheddar cheese (American melts better) 4 slices beefsteak tomatoes 4 slices red onion 4 leaves butter lettuce , Watch how to make this recipe.


              For the turkey burgers: Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and toss in the onion. Season with salt and bring the pan to medium heat. Cook the onion until soft and very aromatic 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool.
            

              In a large mixing bowl combine the turkey water chestnuts soy sauce cilantro ginger sambal if using and the cooked onions and garlic. (NOTE: Save the onion pan to cook the burgers in later!) Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water to the mix--this will keep the burgers really moist! Use your hands to squish the mixture until everything is really well combined.
            

              Make cook and eat a little tester patty to be sure the turkey is really delicious. If the seasoning isn't just right add a little more soy or a sprinkey-dink of salt. When you're confident the burger mix is perfectly seasoned form it into 4 equal patties.
            

              With a paper towel wipe out the saute pan you used to cook the onion coat the pan with fresh olive oil and bring it to medium-high heat. Add the burgers being sure not to crowd the pan--if you need to work in batches knock yourself out. Cook the burgers for 5 to 6 minutes on each side. The burgers should be browned and cooked through when done. (If working in batches keep the first batch warm in the oven at 200 degrees F while cooking the second batch.)
            

              For the toppings: Mix together the mayo and sambal oelek in a small bowl. Toast the burger buns and top with the burgers. Garnish as desired with the cheese tomato red onion lettuce and spicy mayo.

              Vegetables:
            

              Using a sharp veggie peeler shave the celery to get long thin shavings. Put the celery shavings in ice water with half a lemon and its juice and let sit for at least 1 hour or overnight in the refrigerator. The celery will get very crunchy curly and cute.
            

              Bring a pot of well salted water to a boil over medium heat and set up a bowl of well salted ice water. Toss the haricots verts in the boiling water and cook until the beans are tender but still firm. Remove the beans from the boiling water and plunge immediately into the ice water and let them cool. When they are cold and still vibrantly green remove them from the ice water and reserve.
            

              Fish:
            

              Season the fish fillets with salt. Combine the herbs and the potato flakes in a shallow dish. Dip the flesh side of each fillet into the egg wash and then press them into the herb/potato flake mixture. Put on a sheet tray with the crusted side up.

              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and heat it over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking add the fish crusted side down. When the crust has become golden and crispy flip them over then transfer the fish to a baking sheet lined with a cooling rack and put in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes.
            

              Remove the oil in the saute pan and add new oil. Toss in the garlic and crushed red pepper. When the garlic becomes golden and aromatic remove it and discard. Toss in the reserved haricots verts season with salt to taste and roll them around in the oil to heat through. When they are hot turn off the heat and reserve them in the pan.
            

              Remove the celery from the ice water and dry in a salad spinner to remove the excess water. Add the celery to the pan with the beans. Squeeze in the juice from the remaining lemon half and season with salt if needed.
            

              Divide the veggies between 4 serving plates and top with the crusted fish.

              While the liquid is coming to a simmer with a knife separate the cilantro leaves from the stems. If you wish wrap the stems well with string and add to the broth to infuse the liquid with more cilantro flavor. When the liquid is at a simmer add the corn and beans and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes just to heat the ingredients well. Meanwhile chop the cilantro leaves you need anywhere from 1/2 to 1 cup of chopped leaves. Add the cilantro leaves and immediately remove the soup from the heat. Discard the cilantro stems. Add the lime juice and season to taste with salt and cayenne pepper. Ladle the soup out and garnish each portion with sour cream and garnish the sour cream with pimento. Variation: to turn this into a main course soup add 12 ounces of strips of raw chicken when you add the beans and corn. Or add 12 ounces chopped cleaned shrimp after you have added the beans and corn and cook for 2 minutes to cook through.

              For the potatoes: Start by putting the potatoes in a large pot. Cover with 8 cups cold water and add the salt; the water should taste a little salty. Bring to a boil over high heat reduce to a simmer and cook until they feel tender when poked with a fork or knife. Drain and then mash adding the milk and butter. Transfer to a bowl and let cool for at least an hour.
            

              For the filling: Meanwhile add the olive oil to a deep skillet over high heat. Add the onions garlic cumin oregano paprika salt pepper and bay leaf. Turn the heat down to medium-high and cook for 5 to 10 minutes. Add the beef and tomato paste cover and turn the heat down to medium. Cook for about 25 minutes. Remove the lid and stir; the consistency should look like thick chili. Transfer to a pan and spread the mixture out so it cools quickly.
            

              To assemble: Start by portioning the cooled potato mixture about 8 ounces or enough to look like an orange when rolled into a ball. Next take a ball and flatten with your palms while at the same time maintaining a cup shape in one hand. Then with an ice cream scooper fill the potato with the meat filling. Close and seal it with both hands. Repeat with all the potato balls. Set up 3 shallow pans one with the egg wash and the others with the panko. Take a potato ball and put in the egg then in the fine panko back into the egg and then in the coarse panko. Once you have breaded them put them in the refrigerator to firm up about 30 minutes. Fill a deep pot about halfway with oil and heat to about 350 degrees F. Carefully drop the potato balls in the oil and fry in batches until golden brown about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve with Salsa Ranchera.

Basic Pizza Dough Recipe | Paula Deen | Food Network, 1 3/4 cup warm water 1 (1/4-ounce) package active dry yeast (recommended: RapidRise) 2 teaspoons salt 4 1/2 to 5 cups bread flour 3 tablespoons olive oil plus more for bowl Cornmeal for pan ,               Preheat oven at 450 degrees F.
            

              Measure out 1 3/4 cups warm water (it should be pleasantly warm on your wrist). Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water and allow it to activate about 10 minutes.
            

              Put the salt and 2 cups of the flour into a food processor. Pulse 5 times to blend. Pour in the yeast and water and pulse 5 times. Add the olive oil. Add the remaining flour 1 cup at a time pulsing and scraping the sides of the bowl until well blended. As soon as the mixture is combined dump it out onto a well-floured board and knead for 15 turns until the dough is smooth and elastic.
            

              Place the dough in a greased bowl and turn to coat all sides. Cover with plastic wrap or a tea towel. Allow the dough to rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes until doubled in size then punch it down. Divide it in half; each half will make 1 (12-inch) pizza.
            

              Place on a cornmeal-dusted pizza stone pizza pan or cookie sheet. Roll up edge slightly to create a ridge around the pizza. Bake for 16 to 18 minutes or until crust is light brown.
            

              Cook's Note: If using only half dough freeze the other half. Place the dough in a resealable freezer bag. To thaw remove the bag from the freezer and place in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Roll the dough out while cold then allow it to come to room temperature before adding toppings.

Spaetzle Recipe | Food Network, 3 cups all purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 6 large eggs 4 tablespoons water or as needed 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Salt and freshly ground pepper ,               In a large mixing bowl combine the flour and salt and make a well in the center. Whisk the eggs with the water and pour them into the well. By hand or with a wooden spoon begin whisking the egg mixture drawing in a little flour each time you whisk until you have a thick wet doughy mixture. Continue working the dough picking it up as you whisk to incorporate air into the mixture and make it a little bubbly. It should be a thick "dropping" consistency.
            

              There are several ways to form spatzle. The old-fashioned German way is to use a cutting board: spread the dough flat on the board then with a flat spatula cut little ribbons off the edge and push them into rapidly boiling salted water. Or use a spatzle press similar to a potato ricer but with less holes it in fact looks like a giant garlic press. The idea is to push the dough through holes about 3/8 inches in diameter and let them fall into the boiling water - a colander with large holes will work well. If using a colander use a large metal spoon to push the mixture through the holes. When the spatzle rise to the surface of the boiling water give them a gentle stir and cook for about 20 seconds more then drain briefly in a clean colander before tossing with butter salt and pepper. Serve immediately.

              For the flatbread: Combine the yeast sugar and 1/4 cup lukewarm water in a small bowl and let the yeast puff up and proof.
            

              Pour the yeast mixture into a large bowl and add 1 cup lukewarm water the oil and salt. Add 1 cup of the flour and whisk until smoothly combined. Switching to a wooden spoon add the rest of the flour and stir until you have a soft dough.

              Punch down the dough transfer it to an oiled plastic bag and let it proof in the refrigerator at least 4 hours or as long as 3 days.
            

              For the peppered pork loin: To give the roast a quick cure for added flavor stir together the sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt rub the mixture all over the roast and refrigerate for 1 hour or as long as overnight.
            

              Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
            

              Blot the roast dry. Crush the peppercorns with a mortar and pestle (or in a spice-devoted coffee grinder) to a medium-coarse texture. (Some will be finely ground but you want the larger pieces to resemble cracked pepper.) Rub the pepper into the meat saving what doesn't stick for the marinade.
            

              Heat a small saucepan over medium-low heat and add the butter and garlic. Cook until the butter bubbles; add the vinegar thyme and remaining black pepper and remove from the heat.

Remove the skillet roll the roast to another side and baste it with more of the pepper mixture. Continue to roast the meat removing it from the oven every 10 minutes or so to flip and mop until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the roast reads 145 degrees F about 50 minutes total.
            

              Transfer the meat to a platter and let it rest for at least 10 minutes rolling the pork around to sop up its exuded juices. Refrigerate the pork until using. (The pork could also be sliced and served hot at this point.)
            

              For the doctored aioli: Stir together the mayonnaise olive oil salt pepper garlic and lemon zest and juice in a medium bowl. Refrigerate until using.

              Vegetables:
            

              Using a sharp veggie peeler shave the celery to get long thin shavings. Put the celery shavings in ice water with half a lemon and its juice and let sit for at least 1 hour or overnight in the refrigerator. The celery will get very crunchy curly and cute.
            

              Bring a pot of well salted water to a boil over medium heat and set up a bowl of well salted ice water. Toss the haricots verts in the boiling water and cook until the beans are tender but still firm. Remove the beans from the boiling water and plunge immediately into the ice water and let them cool. When they are cold and still vibrantly green remove them from the ice water and reserve.
            

              Fish:

              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
            

              Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and heat it over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking add the fish crusted side down. When the crust has become golden and crispy flip them over then transfer the fish to a baking sheet lined with a cooling rack and put in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes.
            

              Remove the oil in the saute pan and add new oil. Toss in the garlic and crushed red pepper. When the garlic becomes golden and aromatic remove it and discard. Toss in the reserved haricots verts season with salt to taste and roll them around in the oil to heat through. When they are hot turn off the heat and reserve them in the pan.
            

              Remove the celery from the ice water and dry in a salad spinner to remove the excess water. Add the celery to the pan with the beans. Squeeze in the juice from the remaining lemon half and season with salt if needed.

Boiled Egg and Toast Recipe | Nigella Lawson | Food Network, 1 egg Toast Salt Special equipment: 1 matchstick ,               And no I'm not going to give a recipe for a boiled egg but I do feel it's worth reminding you that if the egg is fridge-cold it should go into the pan along with the cold water when you put it on the stove but if it's at room temperature - which is better - you should lower it into the water once it's started boiling. How long you want to cook it for is obviously up to you but a beautiful oozingly golden yolked egg had 4 minutes as indeed mine does every morning. I also throw in a matchstick - rather than the teaspoon of vinegar or salt that some people swear by - but just because my great aunt always did and told me that it stopped the white cloudy substance flowing out should the egg crack while cooking. I think it does work but I do it because I've always done it not because I have scientific proof that it's effective.
            

              And that's the thing about breakfast: there is a strong ritualistic element; that too brings it in line with feasting in general. I have the same breakfast every day. Early mornings are bad enough without having the spectre of choice to haunt you too. First thing in the morning I'd rather make breakfast than a decision and so I only ever swerve from this out of whim or occasionally dietary restraint.
            

              And like everyone with a weak need to be bound by habitual behaviour I am irritatingly fussy. I want my egg to be Italian (free-range organic and imported from Bologna if you please: but seeing it you understand why Italians refer to the yolks as 'I rossi' - 'the reds' of the egg). I want my salt to be Maldon and I want my sourdough bread to come from the Poilane bakery down the road. As ever the butter has to be pale and unsalted and not fridge-cold but not all sloppy-soft and oily either. I don't mind having a different breakfast but I don't want a lesser version of the same one. Maybe it's my age.
            

              I know it is the convention to offer various savoury delights for the breakfast table but in all honesty I can't oblige. My feeling is simply this: apart from the iconic ideal of the boiled egg and soldiers what could be better than fried eggs and bacon poached eggs on toast scrambled egg with sausages? Yes as Lord Lambton memorably said when found with 2 hookers 1 black 1 white we all want variety but I don't see fiddling about with the basic components of a traditional breakfast to make strange and wonderful cheesey-bacony-eggy-bready concoctions ultimately that satisfying.

Red Pepper Spaetzle in Mustard Cream Sauce with Sausage Recipe | Robert Irvine | Food Network, 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil Coriander Spiced Sausage recipe follows 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup jarred roasted red peppers 2 tablespoons goat cheese 4 tablespoons chicken stock 3 cups all-purpose flour 4 eggs 1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley 1/2 cup cold water 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 small shallot minced 3 tablespoons white wine or chicken stock 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons grated Gruyere 2 pounds pork shoulder (with a good amount of fat) cut into large chunks Pinch caraway seed Pinch ground coriander 2 tablespoons fresh oregano 2 tablespoons salt Ice cold water Oil Hog casing , Special equipment: stand mixer with meat grinder and sausage horn attachments

Sauce:


              For the sausage: In a large skillet heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until browned on each side about 5 minutes.
            

              Add 1/2 cup water to the skillet. (You can add a little more if sausage is large.) Cover and cook until the water is nearly evaporated and the sausage is firm 15 to 20 minutes.
            

              For the spaetzle: In a food processor combine the roasted peppers cheese and chicken stock and puree until smooth.
            

              In a large saucepot over high heat bring 4 quarts water to a boil. While the water is heating in a bowl blend 1/2 cup red pepper puree flour eggs parsley 1/2 cup water and salt. Stir until just well mixed. Do not over mix! Over mixing will result in a tough dough.
            

              Once the water comes to a boil reduce the heat to medium. Squeeze or press the dough through a spaetzle maker or a large holed colander. This pressing needs to be completed in a quick manner thus allowing the dough to cook evenly. Once the spaetzle has been dropped into the water cook for 2 to 3 minutes stirring throughout the cooking time.
            

              Once cooked remove from the heat and drain through a colander to retrieve the spaetzle. Drain well.
            

              For the sauce: In a saucepan over medium heat add the butter and shallots cooking until shallots are a light brown and then deglaze with the wine. Once deglazed add the cream thyme Dijon and salt and pepper to taste. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook until the cream has thickened 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese. Toss the spaetzle in the sauce.
            

              Slice the sausage and serve alongside the spaetzle in cream sauce.

Frosted Twists Recipe | Food Network, 2 cups milk 1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast 1/2 cup vegetable shortening 2 large eggs 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 7 to 7 1/2 cups all-purpose flour plus more for dusting Vegetable oil for brushing 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 stick unsalted butter at room temperature 2 3/4 cups confectioners' sugar 2 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature Pinch of kosher salt Coarse or decorating sugar ,               Make the dough: Warm the milk in a small saucepan until steaming. Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water in a large bowl. Add the milk shortening eggs 1/2 cup granulated sugar the salt and 7 cups flour; mix with a wooden spoon until combined. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic adding up to 1/2 cup more flour if the dough is too sticky. Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap; let rise in a warm place until doubled in size about 1 1/2 hours.
            

              Lightly oil 2 baking sheets. Combine the cinnamon and the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar in a small bowl. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-by-24-inch rectangle with a long side facing you. Spread the butter over the right half of the rectangle leaving a 1-inch border around the edges; sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar.
            

              Fold the left half of the dough over the cinnamon sugar like closing a book. Cut the folded dough crosswise into twelve 1-inch-wide strips. Take one strip and twist several times stretching the dough a little; hold one end of the strip against a baking sheet and wind the strip around to form a coil tucking the other end underneath. Repeat with the remaining strips spacing the rolls about 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Lightly cover the baking sheets with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise until doubled in size about 1 hour.
            

              Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Uncover the rolls and bake until lightly browned 25 to 30 minutes. Make the glaze: Beat the confectioners' sugar butter and salt in a bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until combined about 3 minutes. Slowly beat in up to 1/4 cup boiling water until pourable. Drizzle over the warm rolls and top with sprinkles.
